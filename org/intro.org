* Introduction

I am a former Evangelical Christian turned Catholic. I'm not sure
there's any formal definition for this term, but I might like to
take the label *Evangelical Catholic* for myself. Why? Because becoming Catholic
has given me new ways to build a loving relationship with Jesus, in addition to
all the same ways I could do so as an Evangelical Protestant. Thus, I love to
talk about joyful faith in Jesus Christ, and how Catholicism unlocks _all_ of
it. After all, should only Protestants get to be Evangelical?

How can someone go from a loving, personal relationship with Christ as an
Evangelical Christian to a loving relationship with Christ as a Catholic? Many
Protestants will say that is not possible, because the Catholic Church does not
teach the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. Nonetheless, this has been the journey of
not just myself, but many other Catholic converts from various forms of
Protestantism or Anglicanism, not to mention other faiths, as well. This site is
about the matters of faith and reason that led me to Catholicism.

I never would have been open to exploring Catholicism if I had found no lack in
Protestant teachings. Indeed, questions arose for which I found no good answer
in and among my Protestant friends or within the Protestant world. The two most
significant questions for me were as follows:
1. *If the Catholic Church gave us the Bible, why shouldn't the Catholic Church
   be able to authoritatively interpret the Bible?* As I learned more about how
   the Bible came about, I saw how early Church councils defined the contents of
   the Bible. It seemed to me that to draw the boundaries on the contents of the
   Bible is a greater power than the ability to interpret the Bible, for if the
   Church finds some writing objectionable, that very Church that compiled the
   Scriptures now called the Bible should have defined that objectionable text
   out of the Bible.
2. *Was the Eucharist truly the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ?* Jesus taught
   this in John 6. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John martyred within 20
   year of St. John's own death, also seemed to think so. So did the
   preponderance of Christian writers through the centuries. While my own
   Evangelical denomination teaches that elements of communion are merely
   symbolic, and many of my former fellow Christian believers recoiled at the
   thought of Christ being truly present in the bread and grape juice, I was
   startled to learn that even Martin Luther himself thought that Christ was
   truly present in the Eucharist; and John Calvin  taught that Holy Communion
   was much more than a symbol. The symbolist view  was historically considered
   heretical by Christians, until it swept through the Protestant movement in 
   the 1520s. At this time, Ulrich Zwingli promoted a  symbolist view in
   opposition to Martin Luther, who advocated for the Real Presence. Did the first 15 centuries of Christians get it wrong?

As I explored these questions and found considerable evidence to think that the
Catholic Church has the correct position here, I became unsettled in my views
which had been taught to me in my Protestant upbringing. I was forced to learn
more.

In the end, there is *only one reason to become Catholic*: /because the teachings
of the Catholic Church are true/. If the teachings of the Catholic Church are
_not_ true, then Catholicism is not worth our time. However, I believe that its
teachings hold up under scrutiny, indeed.

*Knowing Christ and walking with Him is a journey of joy.* I converted to
Catholicism because after much study and learning, I believe the teachings of
the Catholic Church contain the fullness of truth about God. To know Christ, Who
is the Way, the Truth and the Life, we must discern what is true and hold fast
to it. I invite you to walk with me down this path.

On this site, I attempt to show you the path I waked as I became open to
considering Catholicism. What were the tough questions that I faced? 
scrutinizing the teachigns of the Catholic Church, and as I sought at the same
time to solidify my own beliefs.
