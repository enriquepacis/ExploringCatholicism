#+caption: This is /The Calling of St. Matthew/ by Caravaggio (1599-1600 AD). Caravaggio depicts Levi, the tax collector, going about his business in the activity of his trade, which brought him great wealth through through extortion. Yet, Jesus generously invited Levi to follow Him. Caravaggio paints the moment when Levi recognizes that Our Lord's invitation first as personal and secondly as his own. Levi then had to choose between his fortune or a mysterious and unknown future with this itinerant rabi, Jesus. Would Levi follow his own vision, or that of Jesus? Would he puruse his own will, or God's? What did Levi choose? If he had chosen his own will, purposes, and glory, would we remember St. Matthew to this day? Indeed the painting is anachronistic: the clothing styles from around the 17th century depict a scene from the first century; however, this anachronism liberates the truth depicted here from reaching beyond the first century into the present day. Like Levi, Christ invites all of us at every moment to a deeper walk with Him, a greater surrender to His will, to a deeper conversion, a growing holiness, and into the glorious mystery of who He is. To what are you being called, and what will you choose? Source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew][Wikipedia]].

I am a former Evangelical Christian turned Catholic. I'm not sure
there's any formal definition for this term, but I might like to
take the label *Evangelical Catholic* for myself. Why? Because becoming Catholic
has given me new ways to build a loving relationship with Jesus, in addition to
all the same ways I could do so as an Evangelical Protestant. Thus, I love to
talk about joyful faith in Jesus Christ, and how Catholicism unlocks _all_ of
it. After all, should only Protestants get to be Evangelical?

How can someone go from a loving, personal relationship with Christ as an
Evangelical Christian to a loving relationship with Christ as a Catholic? Many
Protestants will say that is not possible, because the Catholic Church does not
teach the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. Nonetheless, this has been the journey of
not just myself, but many other Catholic converts from various forms of
Protestantism or Anglicanism, not to mention other faiths, as well. This site is
about the matters of faith and reason that led me to Catholicism.

I never would have been open to exploring Catholicism if I had found no lack in
Protestant teachings. Indeed, questions arose for which I found no good answer
in and among my Protestant friends or within the Protestant world. The two most
significant questions for me were as follows:
1. *If the Catholic Church gave us the Bible, why shouldn't the Catholic Church
   be able to authoritatively interpret the Bible?* As I learned more about how
   the Bible came about, I saw how early Church councils defined the contents of
   the Bible. It seemed to me that to draw the boundaries on the contents of the
   Bible is a greater power than the ability to interpret the Bible, for if the
   Church finds some writing objectionable, that very Church that compiled the
   Scriptures now called the Bible should have defined that objectionable text
   out of the Bible.
2. *Was the Eucharist truly the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ?* Jesus taught
   this in John 6. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John martyred within 20
   year of St. John's own death, also seemed to think so. So did the
   preponderance of Christian writers through the centuries. While my own
   Evangelical denomination teaches that elements of communion are merely
   symbolic, and many of my former fellow Christian believers recoiled at the
   thought of Christ being truly present in the bread and grape juice, I was
   startled to learn that even Martin Luther himself thought that Christ was
   truly present in the Eucharist; and John Calvin  taught that Holy Communion
   was much more than a symbol. The symbolist view  was historically considered
   heretical by Christians, until it swept through the Protestant movement in 
   the 1520s. At this time, Ulrich Zwingli promoted a  symbolist view in
   opposition to Martin Luther, who advocated for the Real Presence. Did the first 15 centuries of Christians get it wrong?

As I explored these questions and found considerable evidence to think that the
Catholic Church has the correct position here, I became unsettled in the worldview
which had been taught to me in my Protestant upbringing. I was forced to learn
more.

*Why be Catholic?*
#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>
It is also worthwhile to briefly list some the things that drew me toward
Catholicism. In Catholicism, I can love God in all the same ways I could as a
Protestant (prayer, the reading and teaching of the Holy Scriptures, obedience
to God), and I have new avenues and resources for growth. Some new tools
include:
1. The Sacraments. I--like many Protestants--used to ask, "Why do I need the
   Sacraments?" I have direct access to God. I'm fine with just me, God, and the
   Bible. I've since come to look at the Sacraments as powerful tools that bring
   me into full and intimate contact with God. They are a gift He wants us to
   have. Why wouldn't I we want a gift that God wants me to have? As for me, *I
   want to accept everything the Lord offers me.*
2. New ways to pray.
   1. the Mass is the highest form of prayer for Catholics. It is both public
      and very personal at the same time. It includes an intimate physical and
      spiritual encounter with Jesus, whether I feel it or not. I can go to Mass
      just about every day of the week to encounter Jesus. In the Mass, and
      especially at the reception of the Eucharist, *Christ Gives Himself
      fully to me, and at the same moment, I offer myself--as
      fully as I know how--to Him*.
   2. Mental prayer.

      Mental prayer is a gift that some non-Catholics also enjoy; however,
      within Catholicism, mental prayer--though not entirely up to the
      individual, but also dependent on sovereign action by God Himself--is a
      beautiful, intimate, and powerful form of prayer. Because of this
      dependence on God, we cannot always perform mental prayer at will;
      however, we can by our will prepare ourselves for whatever mental divine
      contact God wills to give us. It will require quieting the impulses of the
      flesh and tuning out the voices of the world and the flesh. Thus, it
      requires effort and openness to God and His ``still, small voice.'' This
      is internal and comtemplative. The objective here is for the soul to be
      ready for God to speak into our lives.

3. Well-developed methods for growing into the image of Christ
   1. The Spiritual Exercises by St. Ignatius
      Spend some time separated from the world in a place of tranquility to
      meditate on the life of Christ and prayerfully consider what God may be
      calling you toward, and discern immediate next steps. Learn how to use
      for the glory of God every aspect of your life and the circumstances God
      has allowed to surround you. The Spiritual exercises were developed by
      St. Ignatius of Antioch, regarded as a spiritual master of discernment.
   2. The practice of spiritual direction
   3. Mental Prayer
   4. Daily prayers and devotions bring Christ into our daily lives
      1. The Rosary
      2. The Angelus.
         Turn your heart toward God at several times during the day. Reflect on
         St. Mary and her example of submitting to God's will, and the
         fruitfulness that submission to God causes in our lives.
      3. The Morning Offering
      4. The /Suscipe/
      5. The Divine Office
   5. The Liturgical Calendar, in which every day is holy and has
      significance.
4. Communion with the angels and the saints. The angels and the saints can pray
   for us!
   1. In a fallen world where celebrities and heroes lead twisted and
      immoral lives, the saints lived lives of heroic virtue and provide examples
      for us on how to love Christ above all the temporal goods this world can
      offer. Not that love for worldy goods is bad; rather love for worldly goods
      that is /disordered/ is bad. There is a specific order: God above all
      goods, for He is our ultimate good; and then, depending on one's state in
      life, other loves should have their proper order: spouse, children, work,
      etc. The saints model for us how to put God first, and we can seek their
      help in doing just that.
   2. God--in His generous love for us--loves each person so much that He has
      appointed at least one guardian  angel specifically to accompany each
      individual. Most of us ingore this powerful being, but, in fact, we can
      ask our guardian angel for intercession and help accoring to God's will.

In the end, there is *only one reason to become Catholic*: /because the teachings
of the Catholic Church are true/. If the teachings of the Catholic Church are
_not_ true, then Catholicism is not worth our time. However, I believe that its
teachings hold up under scrutiny, indeed.

*Knowing Christ and walking with Him is a journey of joy.* I converted to
Catholicism because after much study and learning, I believe the teachings of
the Catholic Church contain the fullness of truth about God. To know Christ, Who
is the Way, the Truth and the Life, we must discern what is true and hold fast
to it. I invite you to walk with me down this path.

On this site, I attempt to show you the path I waked as I became open to
considering Catholicism. What were the tough questions that I faced? 
scrutinizing the teachigns of the Catholic Church, and as I sought at the same
time to solidify my own beliefs.

** Do Protestants /Ever/ Become Catholic?

Yes. We are /legion/. Like me, many Protestants deeply in love with Jesus find
themselves becoming Catholic.

Here are some examples of individuals deeply immersed in Protestantism of
various flavors--high church, low church, evangelical, mainline, etc. After
delving deeper into the Bible and into history, these believers found themselves
becoming Catholics.
