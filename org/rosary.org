26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city
of Galilee named Nazareth,
27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house
of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.
28 And having come in, the angel said to her, ``Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!''

29 But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and
considered what manner of greeting this was.
30 Then the angel said to her, ``Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
found favor with God. 
31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son,
and shall call His name Jesus. 
32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and
the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
33 And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.''

34 Then Mary said to the angel, ``How can this be, since I do not know a man?''

35 And the angel answered and said to her, ``The Holy Spirit will come
upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you;
therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the
Son of God.
36 Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her
old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called
barren.
37 For with God nothing will be impossible.''

38 Then Mary said, ``Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to
me according to your word.'' And the angel departed from her.

*** The Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth (Luke 1:39-56)

#+begin_quote
39 Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with
haste, to a city of Judah, 40 and entered the house of Zacharias and
greeted Elizabeth. 41 And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the
greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 Then she spoke out with a loud voice
and said, ``Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
your womb! 43 But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me? 44 For indeed, as soon as the voice of your
greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 45
Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of
those things which were told her from the Lord.''

46 And Mary said:

``My soul magnifies the Lord,
47 And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
48 For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;
For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.
49 For He who is mighty has done great things for me,
And holy is His name.
50 And His mercy is on those who fear Him
From generation to generation.
51 He has shown strength with His arm;
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
52 He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
And exalted the lowly.
53 He has filled the hungry with good things,
And the rich He has sent away empty.
54 He has helped His servant Israel,
In remembrance of His mercy,
55 As He spoke to our fathers,
To Abraham and to his seed forever.''
56 And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.

*** The Nativity of Our Lord (Luke 2:1-21)

And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. 3 So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.

4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child. 6 So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. 7 And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

*8 Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the
fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.
9 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone 
around them, and they were greatly afraid.
10 Then the angel said to them, ``Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. 
11 For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 
12 And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.''

13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:

14 ``Glory to God in the highest,
And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!''
15 So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven,
that the shepherds said to one another, ``Let us now go to Bethlehem
and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made
known to us.''
16 And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph,
and the Babe lying in a manger.
17 Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
18 And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
20 Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.*

21 And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22 Now when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, ``Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord''),
24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, ``A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.''

25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and
this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel,
and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
26 And it had been revealed to him
by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the
Lord’s Christ.
27 So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when
the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the
custom of the law,
28 he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and
said:

29 ``Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace,
According to Your word;
30 For my eyes have seen Your salvation
31 Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,
32 A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles,
And the glory of Your people Israel.''
33 And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were
spoken of Him.
34 Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His
mother, ``Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of
many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against
35 (yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of
many hearts may be revealed.''

36 Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a
husband seven years from her virginity;
37 and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but
served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
38 And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all
those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

*** The Finding of Our Lord in the Temple (Luke 2:41-52)

#+begin_quote
41 His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the
Passover. 42 And when He was twelve years old, they went up to
Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. 43 When they had
finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in
Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; 44 but supposing
Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought
Him among their relatives and acquaintances. 45 So when they did not
find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. 46 Now so it was
that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the
midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them
questions. 47 And all who heard Him were astonished at His
understanding and answers. 48 So when they saw Him, they were amazed;
and His mother said to Him, ``Son, why have You done this to us? Look,
Your father and I have sought You anxiously.''

49 And He said to them, “Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I
must be about My Father’s business?” 50 But they did not understand
the statement which He spoke to them.

51 Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was
subject to them, but His mother kept all these things in her
heart. 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
God and men.

36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to
the disciples, ``Sit here while I go and pray over there.'' 37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38 Then He said to them, ``My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.''

39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying,
``O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;
nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.''

40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, ``What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.''

42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, ``O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.'' 43 And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.

44 So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying
the same words. 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them,
``Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and
the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise,
let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.''

47 And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48 Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ``Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.'' 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, ``Greetings, Rabbi!'' and kissed Him.

50 But Jesus said to him, ``Friend, why have you come?''

Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. 51 And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

52 But Jesus said to him, ``Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?''

55 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, ``Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me. 56 But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.''

Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.

27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him. 28 And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. 29 When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, ``Hail, King of the Jews!'' 30 Then they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head. 31 And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to be crucified.

*** Our Lord is Crucified (Matthew 27:33-56)

#+begin_verse
33 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull, 34 they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But when He had tasted it, He would not drink.

35 Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: ``They
divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots.''

36 Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there. 37 And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him:

THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38 Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.

39 And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads 40 and
saying, ``You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save
Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.''

41 Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and
elders, said, 42 ``He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is
the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will
believe Him. 43 He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will
have Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' ''

44 Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.

45 Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, ``Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?'' that is, ``My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?''

47 Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, ``This Man is calling for Elijah!'' 48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.

49 The rest said, ``Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.''

50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.

51 Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, 52 and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 53 and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.

54 So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, ``Truly this was the Son of God!''

55 And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar, 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.

1 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the
mother of Jesus was there.
2 Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
3 And when they ran out of wine, the mother of
Jesus said to Him, ``They have no wine.''

4 Jesus said to her, ``Woman, what does your concern have to do with
Me? My hour has not yet come.'' 

5 His mother said to the servants, ``Whatever He says to you, do it.''

6 Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the
manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty
gallons apiece.
7 Jesus said to them, ``Fill the waterpots with water.'' And they
filled them up to the brim.
8 And He said to them, ``Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast.'' And they took it.
9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.
10 And he said to him, ``Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the
inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!''

11 This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.

*** Our Lord is Transfigured (Matthew 17:1-8)

Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led
them up on a high mountain by themselves; 2 and He was transfigured
before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as
white as the light. 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them,
talking with Him. 4 Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, ``Lord, it
is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three
tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.''

5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, ``This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!'' 6 And when the
disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly
afraid. 7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, ``Arise, and do not
be afraid.'' 8 When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but
Jesus only.

*** Our Lord Institutes the Eucharist at the Last Supper (Matthew 26)

17 Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, ``Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?''

18 And He said, ``Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, ``My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.'' ' ''

19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.

20 When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve. 21 Now as they were eating, He said, ``Assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.''

22 And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, ``Lord, is it I?''

23 He answered and said, ``He who dipped his hand with Me in the dish will betray Me. 24 The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.''

25 Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, ``Rabbi, is it I?''

He said to him, ``You have said it.''

26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, ``Take, eat; this is My body.''

27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
``Drink from it, all of you. 28 For this is My blood of the new
covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. 29 But I
say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on
until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.''

30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

#+begin_verse
1 Now the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early,
while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away
from the tomb.
2 Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the
other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ``They have taken
away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid
Him.''

3 Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to
the tomb.
4 So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran
Peter and came to the tomb first. 5 And he, stooping down and looking
in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in. 6 Then
Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw
the linen cloths lying there, 7 and the handkerchief that had been
around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together
in a place by itself. 8 Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb
first, went in also; and he saw and believed. 9 For as yet they did
not know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. 10 Then
the disciples went away again to their own homes.

11 But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she
stooped down and looked into the tomb. 12 And she saw two angels in
white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the
body of Jesus had lain. 13 Then they said to her, ``Woman, why are you
weeping?''

She said to them, ``Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not
know where they have laid Him.''

14 Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus
standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to
her, ``Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?''

She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, ``Sir, if You have
carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him
away.''

16 Jesus said to her, ``Mary!''

She turned and said to Him, ``Rabboni!'' (which is to say, Teacher).

17 Jesus said to her, ``Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet
ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I am
ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.'
''

18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.

19 Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear
of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them,
``Peace be with you.'' 20 When He had said this, He showed them His
hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the
Lord.

21 So Jesus said to them again, ``Peace to you! As the Father has sent
Me, I also send you.'' 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on
them, and said to them, ``Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive
the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of
any, they are retained.''

24 Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them
when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, ``We
have seen the Lord.''

So he said to them, ``Unless I see in His hands the print of the
nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand
into His side, I will not believe.''

26 And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, ``Peace to you!''
27 Then He said to Thomas, ``Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.''

28 And Thomas answered and said to Him, ``My Lord and my God!''

29 Jesus said to him, ``Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.''

them, ``Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?
39 Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and
see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.''

40 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 41
But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to
them, ``Have you any food here?'' 42 So they gave Him a piece of a
broiled fish and some honeycomb. 43 And He took it and ate in their
presence.

44 Then He said to them, ``These are the words which I spoke to you
while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which
were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms
concerning Me.'' 45 And He opened their understanding, that they might
comprehend the Scriptures.

46 Then He said to them, ``Thus it is written, and thus it was
necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third
day, 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And you are
witnesses of these things. 49 Behold, I send the Promise of My Father
upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with
power from on high.''

50 And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands
and blessed them. 51 Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that
He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. 52 And they
worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 53 and were
continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.

*** The Descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-41)

#+begin_quote
When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as
of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they
were sitting. 3 Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of
fire, and one sat upon each of them. 4 And they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
gave them utterance.

5 And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every
nation under heaven. 6 And when this sound occurred, the multitude
came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in
his own language. 7 Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to
one another, ``Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? 8 And how
is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?
9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia,
Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt
and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews
and proselytes, 11 Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our
own tongues the wonderful works of God.'' 12 So they were all amazed
and perplexed, saying to one another, ``Whatever could this mean?''

13 Others mocking said, ``They are full of new wine.''

14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said
to them, ``Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be
known to you, and heed my words. 15 For these are not drunk, as you
suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. 16 But this is
what was spoken by the prophet Joel:

17 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God,
That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;
Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
Your young men shall see visions,
Your old men shall dream dreams.
18 And on My menservants and on My maidservants
I will pour out My Spirit in those days;
And they shall prophesy.
19 I will show wonders in heaven above
And signs in the earth beneath:
Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
20 The sun shall be turned into darkness,
And the moon into blood,
Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.
21 And it shall come to pass
That whoever calls on the name of the Lord
Shall be saved.'

22 ``Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man
attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did
through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know— 23 Him, being
delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have
taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; 24 whom God
raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not
possible that He should be held by it. 25 For David says concerning
Him:

`I foresaw the Lord always before my face,
For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.
26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;
Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.
27 For You will not leave my soul in Hades,
Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
28 You have made known to me the ways of life;
You will make me full of joy in Your presence.'

29 ``Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch
David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to
this day. 30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had
sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to
the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, 31 he,
foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that
His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. 32
This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. 33
Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received
from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this
which you now see and hear.

34 ``For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:

'The Lord said to my Lord,
``Sit at My right hand,
35 Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.'' '
36 ``Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has
made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.''

37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to
Peter and the rest of the apostles, ``Men and brethren, what shall we
do?''

38 Then Peter said to them, ``Repent, and let every one of you be
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and
you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is
to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as
the Lord our God will call.''

*** The Assumption of Mary into Heaven 

*** The Coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth (Revelation 12)

The /New Advent/ rosary sheet did not give a scripture reference for
this, so I chose Revelation 12.

#+begin_quote
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with
the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She
was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3
Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with
seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 4 Its tail
swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the
earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give
birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. 5 She
gave birth to a son, a male child, who ``will rule all the nations with
an iron scepter.'' And her child was snatched up to God and to his
throne. 6 The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for
her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.

7 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But he was
not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great
dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or
Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth,
and his angels with him.

10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:

``Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our
God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers
and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been
hurled down. 11 They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and
by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much
as to shrink from death. 12 Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who
dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has
gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his
time is short.'' 

13 When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he
pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 The woman
was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the
place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken
care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s
reach. 15 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river,
to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 16 But the
earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river
that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. 17 Then the dragon was
enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her
offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony
about Jesus.
