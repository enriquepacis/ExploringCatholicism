* Saved by Faith Alone?

** Introduction

A dogma central to Luther's Protestant reformation is summarized by the phrase
/sola fide/, which is translated "by faith alone." This encapsulates the idea
that man is saved or /justified/ in God's sight by faith alone.

Thus, it is important to ask the question: can man be saved by faith alone?

If you wish, you may view a video I made on this very topic:
#+html: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBypIA26vTs?si=BejzbpaN9AkIwvbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My conditioning to believe in /sola fide/ was one of the major obstacles for me
to embracing Catholicism, even though I was already persuaded that /sola
scriptura/ was not defensible, and I favored the Orthodox teaching of the Real
Presence of Christ in the Eucharist over the symbolist interpretation of some
Protestant groups.

Jimmy Akin provides one of the clearest and most comprehensive discussions on
/sola fide/ that I've seen. A great challenge here is that the Bible uses
/faith/ in a few different ways, and it leads us as Christians to understand
faith differently. Jimmy helps us navigate this and find a common understanding
of the various ways /faith/ is used in the Scriptures. In the end, I think it's
helpful to use this more common language so that we can actually compare and
contrast Catholic and Protestant views on the role of faith in salvation. It's
worthwhile, indeed.

** Evidence For /Sola Fide/
Many proponents of /sola fide/ say that the Bible plainly states that man is
saved by faith alone in Ephesians 2:8-10:
#+begin_quote
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing;
it is the gift of God— not the result of works, so that no one may boast
([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-10&version=NRSVCE][Ephesians 2:8-10, NRSVCE]])
#+end_quote
This verse /excludes/ works as a means of salvation, leaving only grace and
faith as causes of salvation. Thus, a /sola-fide/ adherent will reason, no works
done by a human can earn their salvation, and only faith can save.

Furthermore, additional verses support the exclusion of works as a means of
salvation:
1. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A20&version=NRSVCE][Romans 3:20 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   For “no human being will be justified in his sight” by
   deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
   #+end_quote
2. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A27&version=NRSVCE][Romans 3:27 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? By that of works?
   No, but by the law of faith.
   #+end_quote
3. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16&version=NRSVCE][Galatians 2:16 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but
   through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ
   Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing
   the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the
   law.
   #+end_quote
4. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A5&version=NRSVCE][Galatians 3:5 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by
   your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
   #+end_quote
5. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A10%2D13&version=NRSVCE][Galatians 3:11-13 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is
   written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
   written in the book of the law.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
   before God by the law; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[a]
   12 But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the
   works of the law will live by them.” 
   #+end_quote

Because of verses such as these, proponents of /sola fide/ support the dogma
that man is justified not by works, but rather by faith alone. Works are
insufficient in this view to /justify/ humans--that is, to qualify us for
salvation and an afterlife in the loving presence of God.

*Eternal Security or the Perseverance of the Saints*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>
/Sola Fide/ also leads to another dogma called *eternal security* or *the
perseverance of the saints*. Eternal security follows from /sola fide/, for since
one's works cannot contrubte to salvation, they cannot imperil one's
salvation. However, even in the Protestant world, there is poor agreement about
the perseverance of the saints: Calvinists and Baptitsts tend toward the
perseverance of the saints, but numerous Evangelical denominations follow the
Arminian tradition, which teaches that a Christian may lose his or her
salvation. From this, we can deduce that there is no Scripture that 
irrevocably establishes eternal security, or the debate would be laid to rest. 

Furthermore, several passages of Scripture suggest that one can fall
away from salvation. At the very least, these Scriptures should indicate that
eternal security is not such a secure doctrine. Notable Scripture passages
include: 
1. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A1-23&version=NIV][Matthew 13:1-23 (RSVCE)]]: Here, Jesus gives the Parable of the Sower:

   #+html: <details>

   #+html: <summary>Read more...</summary>   
   #+begin_quote
   3 Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to
   sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and
   the birds came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not
   have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But
   when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because
   they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked
   the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a
   hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them
   hear.”
   #+end_quote
   This left his audience, including his disciples puzzled. Later, He explained
   it to His disciples:
   #+begin_quote
   18 “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 19 When anyone hears
   the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes
   and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along
   the path. 20 The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the
   word and at once receives it with joy. 21 But since they have no root, they
   last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the
   word, they quickly fall away. 22 The seed falling among the thorns refers to
   someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the
   deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. 23 But the seed
   falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands
   it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty
   times what was sown.” 
   #+end_quote

   For clarity, we pair each class of seed with the type of human heart:
   1. Seed along the path illustrates people who do not grasp the
      message about the kingdom of God.
      
      /Parable text/:
      #+begin_quote
      4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and
      the birds came and ate it up.
      #+end_quote
      /Explanation/:
      #+begin_quote
      19 When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand
      it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their
      heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
      #+end_quote
   2. Seed in rocky places illustrates people who receive the message, but do
      not persevere in it.
      
      /Parable text/:
      #+begin_quote
      5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up
      quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the
      plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 
      #+end_quote
      /Explanation/:
      #+begin_quote
      20 The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word
      and at once receives it with joy. 21 But since they have no root, they
      last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the
      word, they quickly fall away. 
      #+end_quote
      This raises some interesting questions:
      1. In the parable, "It sprang up quickly" is "someone who hears the word."
         Did the person experience the life of Christ and then fall away? The
         defender of eternal security would say they never were a believer in
         the first place, but is that a sound interpretation? The defensor of
         eternal security will say that it is sound, because it supports the
         desired narrative and fits in with the interpretive lens of eternal
         security. However, it appears that in contrast to the individual who
         simply did not understand the message, this person actually did, and
         this person bore evidence of the new life in Christ; and that this
         person failed to persevere.
      2. What does "fall away" mean? The eternal security ally would say that
         such a person only looked like a genuine beleiver, but really wasn't in
         the first place. But, how can one "fall away" if they were not first
         connected to Christ in the first place?
      The seed on rocky ground seems to represent individuals who fall away from
      their salvation due to external pressures (trouble or persecution). For
      simplicity, we may call this the /weak Christian/, since he cannot endure
      the trouble or persecution.
   3. Seed falling among thorns is paired with individuals who fail to persevere
      due to a temporal, worldly perspective obscuring their perspective on
      things eternal.
      
      /Parable text/:
      #+begin_quote
      7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
      #+end_quote
      /Explanation/:
      #+begin_quote
      22 The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word,
      but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the
      word, making it unfruitful.
      #+end_quote
      Like the weak Christian, this, worldly Christian exhibits the new life,
      but fails to persevere. This new life is choked out (it could not be
      choked out if it was not alive in the first place) because this new
      believer is distracted from things eternal by things of the world.
   4. Seed falling on good soil represents fruitful Christians.
      
      /Parable text/:
      #+begin_quote
      8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred,
      sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
      #+end_quote
      /Explanation/:
      #+begin_quote
      23 But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word
      and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a
      hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”
      #+end_quote
      The defender of eternal security may suggest that since the fruitful
      Christian is described as one who hears and understands the message, the
      weak Christian (group 2) and the worldly Christian (group 3) did not
      understand the message and were not truly Christian in the first
      place. However, since Christ spoke of this seed germinating and groups 2
      and 3 also hearing, they have more in common with the fruitful Christian
      (group 4) than group 1 (those who did not understand). It is more likely
      that groups 2 and 3 really were Christians, and they understood the
      message, but not to the same extent that the Christians of group 4
      did. The fruitful Christians understood that Christ is their very life,
      and they held on to the end; but groups 2 and 3 did not fully grasp this,
      and they were persuaed by difficult external circumstances or a misguided
      heart that to abandon Christ would be better than to endure.

   The defender of eternal security may interpret this to be a warning
   against fruitlessness rather than an indication about the loss of one's
   salvation. Nonetheless, this indicates an individual can fall away from
   Christ.

   The next passage raises the stakes and gives a firm warning against
   fruitlessness, indicating dire consequences for fruitlessness because of a
   failure to abide in Christ.

2. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A1-8&version=RSVCE][John 15:1-8 (RSVCE)]]:
   #+begin_quote
   15 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch of
   mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear
   fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 3 You are already made clean by
   the word which I have spoken to you. 4 *Abide in me, and I in you.* As the
   branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can
   you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He who
   abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me
   you can do nothing. 6 *If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a
   branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and
   burned.* 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you
   will, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this my Father is glorified, that
   you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.
   #+end_quote
   This passage is taken from St. John's narrative of the Last Supper, and
   Jesus' disciples were present. These were His inner circle, the Twelve
   Apostles. Jesus conditions the bearing of fruit with abiding in Him, and He
   commands the Twelve to abide in Him. Several interesting questions arise
   here:
   1. Why would Jesus command the Twelve to abide in Him if it were impossible
      for them to stop abiding in Him?
   2. Why does Christ warn about /not abiding/ in Him if it were impossible to
      stop abiding in Him?
   3. Furthermore, why would Jesus warn about the consequences of not abiding in
      Him if it were impossible to stop abiding in Him?
   4. What are the consequences of failing to abide in Jesus?
      1. What does it mean to wither away?
      2. How can a branch wither if it is not first a healthy part of the vine?
      3. What does it mean for a withered branch to be burned in fire?
   
3. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024%3A3-13&version=RSVCE][Matthew 24:3-13 (RSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately,
   saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming
   and of the close of the age?” 4 And Jesus answered them, “*Take heed that no
   one leads you astray*. 5 For  many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the
   Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will hear of wars and
   rumors of wars; see that you are not  alarmed; for this must take place, but
   the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom
   against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places:
   8 all this is but the beginning of the sufferings.
   
   9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and
   you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then *many will
   fall away*, and betray one another, and hate one another. 11 And many false
   prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because wickedness is
   multiplied, most men’s love will grow cold. 13 But *he who endures to the end 
   will be saved*. 
   #+end_quote

   Some key questions arise here:
   1. Why would Jesus have warned His disciples of being led astray if that were
      not possible?
   2. Why would Christ have been warning about _falling away_ if that were not
      possible?
   3. What does /falling away/ mean? How can one /fall away/ if they were never
      joined to Christ in the first place?
   4. Does verse 13 inicate that it is possible to fail to endure to the end?
      This _does not_ say /he who is saved endures to the end/ (i.e., that
      salvation determines endurace as in the Calvinist or Baptist
      undrstanding), but rather that /endurace merits salvation/.
4. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A9-10&version=ESV][Romans 5:9-10 (ESV)]]. I've chosen a Protestant translation here, so that we
   can avoid any potential Catholic translation bias. It reads:
   #+begin_quote
   9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall
   we be saved by him from the wrath of God. 10 For if while we were enemies we
   were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are
   reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
   #+end_quote
   This provides some really interesting material. The Catholic and Protestant
   can agree that that we are justified by Christ's blood, and that we are
   reconciled by the death of God's son. Now, the defender of eternal security
   and some Protestants will disagree. One will say that salvation is complete
   at this point, but this text raises some problems: after reconciliation by
   Christ's death, the passage indicates that there is still a /further/ or
   /subsequent/ or /more complete/ salvation that is wrought by the life of
   Christ.

   In the view of /sola fide/ and eternal security, this passage is very
   difficult to interpret. What additional salvation is required apart from that
   brought by the blood of Christ? According to this view, Christ's death
   completes human salvation, and there is nothing that can be added to
   this. But, why, then, does this passage suggest that Christ's life saves us
   /after/ reconcilliation with Christ by His death?

   This is resolved in the Catholic view. Indeed, Christ's death (blood) has
   reconciled us to God. Yet, we have free will and the capacity to turn away
   from God before death. In order to persevere to the end of our lives, we need
   supernatural help from God: this is sanctifying grace (the life of Christ),
   which is given to us in the Sacraments. Partaking of the Sacraments with a
   proper disposition (not in a state of willful and mortal sin) gives us
   the power to live the Christian life, as well as the restoration to that life
   if we should forsake it through mortal sin. When we approach the Sacraments
   with the proper disposition--indeed, one of repentance from sin and
   cooperation with His grace, not in pride and rebellion--we are transformed
   and drawn near to God. Our will and cooperation with His grace builds us up
   and brings us toward Him, breaking the power of sin in our lives and
   conforming ourselves to the likeness of Christ. This is how the life of Christ
   saves us, building on the reconcilliation we have with God through His death.
   
5. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2011&version=RSVCE][Romans 11 (RSVCE)]]. Paul describes the rebellion of Israel against God and
   their rejection of Jesus Christ.
   #+begin_quote
   11:1 I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an
   Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. ...
   11 So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their
   trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. 12
   Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means
   riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!

   13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the
   Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 14 in order to make my fellow Jews jealous,
   and thus save some of them. 15 For if their rejection means the
   reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from
   the dead? 16 If the dough offered as first fruits is holy, so is the whole
   lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

   17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot,
   were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive tree, 18 do
   not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not you that
   support the root, but the root that supports you. 19 You will say, “Branches
   were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 20 That is true. They were
   broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through
   faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. 21 *For if God did not spare
   the natural branches, neither will he spare you.* 22 Note then the kindness
   and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but *God’s
   kindness to you, _provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too
   will be cut off_.* 23 And even the others, if they do not persist in their
   unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in
   again. 24 For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree,
   and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more
   will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree. 
   #+end_quote

   Here, Paul promises and warns his readers, who are Gentile believers, that
   they will be cut off from God if they do not continue in His kindness. This
   follows from his discussion that God has even cut off the Jews, the
   recipients of His old covenant, because of their disbelief and
   disobedience. *The Christians, Paul says, are no more secure than the Jews.*

6. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206%3A4-7&version=RSVCE][Hebrews 6:4-7 (RSVCE)]]. The writer describes individuals who have truly tasted
  the heavenly gift and partaken of the Holy Spirit, and then fall away.
  #+begin_quote
  4 For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those _who have once
  been enlightened_, who _have tasted the heavenly gift_, and *have become
  partakers of the Holy Spirit*, 5 and have _tasted the goodness of the word of
  God and the powers of the age to come_, 6 if they then commit apostasy, since
  they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to
  contempt. 7 For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and
  brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated,
  receives a blessing from God. 
  #+end_quote
  This is a very interesting and powerful verse, for it speaks of those cannot
  be _restored_ *after* having become _partakers of the Holy Spirit_, having
  _tasted of the goodness of God_ and having come to _know the powers of the
  age to come_.

  Proponents of eternal security would attempt to argue that these individuals
  only /appeared/ to be saved, but it was the case that they were never saved
  in the first place. Some have even suggested to me in dialog that these
  people were not enlightened by the Holy Spirit, despite the fact that the
  text says they were enlightened and partakers of the Holy Spirit before
  needing an (impossible) restoration. It would be pointless to talk of
  /restoration/ if the person had not initially been in a state of grace.

  Some have responded to this verse by saying that it's complex, unclear, and can be
  interpreted in many ways. This response is not adequate, because it does not
  suggest an interpretation that supports eternal security, but only attempts
  to obscure a verse that reads in a simple way to cast *significant doubt*
  upon eternal security.
   
7. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201%3A10-11&version=RSVCE][1 Peter 1:10-11 (RSVCE)]]. Peter says that it is possible to fall away.
   
8. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A4&version=NIV][Galatians 5:4 (RSVCE)]]. St. Paul says individuals may fall away from grace. It
   is impossible to fall from grace if one were not first /in grace/.
9. Philippians 3:7-14 (RSVCE). St. Paul speaks of _not already having attained_
   his goal, and not already having become perfected. He wanrs us to keep
   striving, like he does, to attain the _resurrection from the dead_:
   #+begin_quote
   7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed
   I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
   Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count
   them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not
   having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through
   faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith; 10 that I
   may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings,
   becoming like him in his death, 11 that if possible I may attain the
   resurrection from the dead. 

   12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on
   to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13 Brethren, I
   do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what
   lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on toward the
   goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Let those of us
   who are mature be thus minded; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, God
   will reveal that also to you. 
   #+end_quote
10. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A16-17&version=RSVCE][1 John 5:16-17 (RSVCE)]]. In verses 16-17, St. John speaks of mortal sin: "16 If any one sees
    his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God will
    give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is
    mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin,
    but there is sin which is not mortal." Protestant Bible translations tend to
    render "mortal" as "sin leading to death". The important question is, what
    does /mortal/ mean? It is helpful to notice that the context of this verse is
    in a discussion where St. John equates eternal life with a relationship with
    the Son of God (see [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A11-13&version=RSVCE][11-13]]): to possess the Son of God is to have eternal life
    (see also [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A1-3&version=RSVCE][John 17:1-3]], where eternal life is equated with *knowing Jesus and
    the Father Who sent Him*). What, then, is death? It the opposite of being in
    relationship with and posessing the Son of God and having eternal life: it is
    separation from the Son of God, and being bereft of eternal life. Thus,
    commiting mortal sin is the tearing away of oneself from union with God, and
    thus the loss of eternal life.

    Thus, it is _not_ that life is given to us in an eternal (timeless) and
    irrevocable manner; rather, eternity is a quality of the life that is given
    to us, and this life is none other than Jesus. We still have the opportunity
    to fail to abide in that life, and by our mortal sin to reject this life,
    which is eternal. In other words, /eternal/ does not describe the way in
    which the life is given; rather, it describes the life itself, which is
    Jesus, Who is eternal. Nowhere in the Scriptures nor the tradition which gave
    us the Scripture does it say that our relationship with Christ is unbreakable
    by our own high-handed disobedience. Rather, we are left with a significant
    corpus of Scripture and tradition that indicates that our relationship with
    Christ can be lost through mortal sin or apostasy.

Catholic Answers has an excellent article: [[https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#][What the Early Church Believed:
Mortal Sin]]. This provides important context, because in the case of the Didache,
these authors wrote the Scriptures (in the case of the Didache), or played
important roles in the establishing of the Canon of Scripture identified in the
late 4th Century.

Additional Scriptures that proponents of eternal security use as "proof texts"
for this dogma include:
1. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A27-30&version=RSVCE][John 10:27-30 (RSVCE)]]. "27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they
   follow me; 28 and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and
   no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to
   me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the
   Father’s hand." Proponents of eternal security may argue that if one could
   lose his salvation, then that life is not eternal. Or, they may point to the
   statement that no one may be snatched from the saving hand of Christ or God
   the Father.
   
   While this passage clearly teaches that a person's salvation cannot be
   disrupted by a third party, it _does not_ clearly refute the idea that a
   person could walk away from their own salvation, that is to willingly crawl
   out of the saving hand of God. This possibility is left open.

   Another interpretation is that the eternal life given is in fact not eternal
   if it can be lost. We have already dealt with this point above, where we
   discuss John's own understanding of eternal ife as relationship with Jesus,
   for Jesus Himself is our life. /Eternal life/ does not necessarily mean that
   life is given eternally, but that the life (Jesus) which is given to us is
   eternal. Other Scriptures (discussed above) leave open the possibiltiy of
   severing our relationship with Christ through mortal sin or failing to bear
   fruit.

2. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010%3A14&version=RSVCE][Hebrews 10:14 (RSVCE)]]. "14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all
   time those who are sanctified."

   Proponents of eternal security suggest that this past-tense language of
   having perfected believing Christians once and for all, so that salvation is
   a "one and done" deal. Yet, when read in context, this passage is not about
   eternal security. Hebrews 10 compares the sacrifice of Christ to the animal
   sacrifices of the old covenant. The animal sacrifices had to be repeated on a
   yearly basis, and it could not actually absolve sins; Christ's sacrifice
   occured only once, and it is done and efficacious for saving Christians.

   Furthermore, St. Paul speaks of /not being perfected yet/ in Philippians 3:
   #+begin_quote
   8 Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of
   knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all
   things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be
   found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that
   which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on
   faith; 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may
   share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that /if possible I
   may attain the resurrection from the dead/.

   12 _Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect_; but I press
   on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13
   Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do,
   forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I
   press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
   #+end_quote
   
In summary, the challenges to eternal security are great. While some passages
even suggest that salvation can be lost, no passage decisively says that a
Christian cannot reject his salvation. Based on the lack of evidence for eternal
security, it seems very difficult to defend the concept.

At this point, as so many doctrinal discussions do, it comes down to
interpretations. The Baptist/Calvinist interpretation is for eternal security;
the Arminian interpretation is against eternal security. Under the dogma of
/sola scriptura/, there is no resolution here, or it would have been resolved
hundreds of years ago. Fortunately, Christ did not leave us with /sola
scriptura/ and only the Scriptures to detetermine our doctrine infallibly; He
gave us a Church, and instructed us to hand down the faith through Her teaching
([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A16-20&version=RSVCE][Matthew 28:16-20]]). This was the very Church that raised up disciples and martyrs, endured
persecution, and after hundreds of years, identified the Scriptures as those
writings which could be read in the liturgy. The Church has the testimony of the
authors of scripture, as well as the testimony of those Christians to whom the
Scriptures were written. Eternal security was not part of Christian teaching
historically and only emerged within the context of the Protestant Reformation
with the likes of John Calvin.

*The Origin of the Protestant Doctrine of Eternal Security*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>
The dogma of *eternal security*—the belief that a person who is truly saved
cannot lose their salvation—did not exist as a formalized doctrine in the
earliest centuries of Christianity. It developed over time, with its clearest
articulation emerging during the *Protestant Reformation*, particularly in
*Calvinist theology* in the 16th century.

_Historical Development_:

/Early Christianity (1st–5th centuries)/:
- Early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius of Antioch, Origen, Tertullian,
  Augustine) generally believed that salvation could be lost through serious sin
  or apostasy.
- The Christian life was seen as a process requiring perseverance; passages like
  Hebrews 6:4–6 and Matthew 24:13 were interpreted to mean believers must remain
  faithful to the end.
/Medieval Period (5th–15th centuries)/:
- The Western Church (later Roman Catholic) maintained that *grace can be
  lost* through mortal sin, but restored through repentance and the sacraments
  (especially confession).
- No concept resembling "once saved, always saved" was part of official doctrine.

/Protestant Reformation (16th century)/:
- *Martin Luther* taught justification by faith alone, but did not emphasize
  eternal security in the Calvinist sense.
- *John Calvin* developed the doctrine of the *perseverance of the saints*—-a core
  part of his theology (TULIP). He taught that those whom God elects will
  inevitably persevere in faith and cannot fall away.
  - This is the clearest root of the modern doctrine of *eternal security*.
- *Other Reformers* (like the Anabaptists and later Arminians) rejected this and
  emphasized the possibility of falling from grace. 

/Post-Reformation and Evangelical Movements/:
- *Arminianism* (developed by Jacobus Arminius, early 17th century) opposed
  Calvinism and taught that believers could lose their salvation.
- In the 18th–19th centuries, some evangelical groups (especially Baptists and
  later dispensationalists) promoted *eternal security* as a central tenet. 
- The *"once saved, always saved"* slogan is especially common in modern
  evangelical and fundamentalist circles, particularly among Southern Baptists.

/Summary/:
- The *formal doctrine* of eternal security *arose during the Reformation* (16th
  century) and is especially associated with *John Calvin*.
- It was not held by the early Church or the medieval Church.
- It remains a *point of disagreement* between different Christian traditions
  (e.g., Calvinism vs. Arminianism, Protestantism vs. Catholicism/Orthodoxy).

Proponents of /sola fide/ also may make a distinction between justification and
sanctification. Justification is a process by which a human is declared
righteous and qualified for salvation, despite personal flaws and moral
imperfection. Justification is believed by /sola-fide/-ists to be independent of
works, but sanctification--the process of becoming holy and Christ-like--is not
necessary for salvation.

In view of the fact that salvation (justification) is by faith alone through
grace alone, another belief is common among proponents of /sola fide/: that the
Gospel (Good News of salvation) depends on faith, not works; and, anyone who
trust in anything else for salvation apart from faith is condemned. This is
directly supported by a verse from Paul the Apostle in the /Epistle to the
Galatians/:
#+begin_quote
You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus
Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified! 2 The only thing I want to learn
from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by
believing what you heard? 3 Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit,
are you now ending with the flesh? 4 Did you experience so much for nothing?—if
it really was for nothing. 5 Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit
and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your
believing what you heard? 

Just as Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” 
so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham. And the
scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the
gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the Gentiles shall be blessed in
you.” For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who
believed. 

For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is
written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
written in the book of the law.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
before God by the law; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[b] 12
But the law does not rest on faith; oMn the contrary, “Whoever does the works of
the law will live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a
tree”— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to
the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

** Evidence Against /Sola Fide/
The first and most importnat an important piece of evidence against /sola fide/
is found in the body of Scripture itself:
#+begin_quote
You see that a person is *justified by works* and *not by faith alone*. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A24&version=NRSVCE][James 2:24
(NRSVCE)]]
#+end_quote
Interestingly, this is the *only place* in /all of the Christian Scriptures/ where
the "faith alone" is used, and it clearly states that salvation is *not* by
faith alone, but rather, *works play a role in justification*.

At its very best, /sola fide/ is not scriptural, but rather *antiscriptural*,
that is, contrary to the Scriptures.

The Gospel is *not* that man is saved by grace alone through faith alone.

How can we balance James with the Scriptures mentioned above that indicate works
do not save a person? The Catholic response is that the preponderance of the
above works do not speak about _works in general_ as being ineffectual, but
rather the *works of the law* are ineffectual. What are the works of the law?
These are *circumcision, animal sacrifices, etc*. It is these works of the law
that are inneffectual for salvation, but good works done in /charity/ are in fact
meritorious for salvation.

In fact, let us review the above passges and highlight the concept of the *works
of the law* in them:
1. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A20&version=NRSVCE][Romans 3:20 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   For “no human being will be justified in his sight” by deeds prescribed by
   the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
   #+end_quote
2. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A27&version=NRSVCE][Romans 3:27 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? By that of works?
   No, but by the law of faith.
   #+end_quote
3. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16&version=NRSVCE][Galatians 2:16 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   yet we know that a person is justified not by the _works of the law_ but
   through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ
   Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing
   the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the _works of the
   law_.
   #+end_quote
4. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A5&version=NRSVCE][Galatians 3:5 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by
   your doing the _works of the law_, or by your believing what you heard?
   #+end_quote
5. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A10%2D13&version=NRSVCE][Galatians 3:11-13 (NRSVCE)]]
   #+begin_quote
   For all who rely on the _works of the law_ are under a curse; for it is
   written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
   written in the book of the _law_.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
   before God by the _law_; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[a]
   12 But the _law_ does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the
   _works of the law_ will live by them.” 
   #+end_quote
   
Now, we can see the importance of works for salvation. We start with the words
of Jesus, where he speaks of the judgement of the righteous unto eternal life,
and the unrighteous to damnation, where righteousness is tied to a person's
/works/: 
#+begin_quote
31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will
sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and
he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 

34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by
my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the
creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I
was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited
me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after
me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’ 

37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and
feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a
stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we
see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ 

40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the
least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ 

41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed,
into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry
and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did
not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’ 

44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a
stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the
least of these, you did not do for me.’

46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal
life."

(Matthew 15:31-46 NIV)
#+end_quote

St. Paul also indicates that a person must work toward salvation:
#+begin_quote
"12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much
more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for
it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure." 
(Philippians 2:12-13 NIV).
#+end_quote

Additionally, John speaks of the judgment of all the dead:
#+begin_quote
11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and
the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12 And I
saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged
according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13 The sea gave up the
dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them,
and each person was judged according to what they had done. 14 Then death and
Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second
death. 15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown
into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15, NIV)
