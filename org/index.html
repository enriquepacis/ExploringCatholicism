<h2 id="orgfe3cf5a"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I am a former Evangelical Christian turned Catholic.
</p>

<p>
How can someone go from a loving, personal relationship with Christ as an
Evangelical Christian to a loving relationship with Christ as a Catholic? Many
Protestants will say that is not possible, because the Catholic Church does not
teach the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. Nonetheless, this has been the journey of
not just myself, but many other Catholic converts from various forms of
Protestantism or Anglicanism, not to mention other faiths, as well. This site is
about the matters of faith and reason that led me to Catholicism.
</p>

<p>
I never would have been open to exploring Catholicism if I had found no lack in
Protestant teachings. Indeed, questions arose for which I found no good answer
in and among my Protestant friends or within the Protestant world. The two most
significant questions for me were as follows:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>If the Catholic Church gave us the Bible, why shouldn't the Catholic Church
be able to authoritatively interpret the Bible?</b> As I learned more about how
the Bible came about, I saw how early Church councils defined the contents of
the Bible. It seemed to me that to draw the boundaries on the contents of the
Bible is a greater power than the ability to interpret the Bible, for if the
Church finds some writing objectionable, that very Church that compiled the
Scriptures now called the Bible should have defined that objectionable text
out of the Bible.</li>
<li><b>Was the Eucharist truly the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ</b> Jesus taught
this in John 6. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John martyred within 20
year of St. John's own death, also seemed to think so. So did the
preponderance of Christian writers through the centuries. While my own
Evangelical denomination teaches that elements of communion are merely
symbolic, and many of my former fellow Christian believers recoiled at the
thought of Christ being truly present in the bread and grape juice, I was
startled to learn that even Martin Luther himself thought that Christ was
truly present in the Eucharist; and John Calvin  taught that Holy Communion
was much more than a symbol. The symbolist view  was historically considered
heretical by Christians, until it swept through the Protestant movement in 
the 1520s. At this time, Ulrich Zwingli promoted a  symbolist view in
opposition to Martin Luther, who advocated for the Real Presence. Did the first 15 centuries of Christians get it wrong?</li>
</ol>

<p>
As I explored these questions and found considerable evidence to think that the
Catholic Church has the correct position here, I became unsettled in my view,
which had been taught to me in my Protestant upbringing. I was forced to learn
more.
</p>

<p>
In the end, there is only one reason to become Catholic: <i>because the teachings
of the Catholic Church are true</i>. If the teachings of the Catholic Church are
<span class="underline">not</span> true, then Catholicism is not worth our time. However, I believe that its
teachings hold up under scrutiny, indeed.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga24fc15" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga24fc15"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Truth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
It is helpful to begin with the concept of <b>truth</b>, because if there is no truth, then
there is no point in discussion. We show first that <b>there must be truth</b>;
and second, that <b>truth is absolute</b>. Along the way, we pick up an important
tool, <b>the principle of non-contradiction</b>, which we can use to demonstrate that
some ideas (or propositions) are invalid and must be rejected.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9e9f43e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9e9f43e"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> There <span class="underline">must</span> be Truth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
An important starting point is truth. Truth must exist, and it must be
absolute. If not, then why do we even spend time talking, discussing, and
debating? Why not allow everyone to go off on their own and manifest his or her
own reality as he or she sees fit? Clearly this is absurd.
</p>

<p>
We can more rigorously conclude that <i>there must be truth</i> if we start with the
another antithetical proposition, which we call <b>proposition A</b>:
</p>
<div class="info" id="orge0f8425">
<p>
<b>Proposition A</b> <br />
There is no truth.
</p>

</div>
<p>
The problem with proposition <b>A</b> arises when we ask, "Is <b>A</b> true?" If the
response is <b>yes</b>, then a truth exists, and <b>A</b> becomes false. This is a
contradiction, and it cannot possibly be valid according to the rules of logic,
namely the principle of non-contradiction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5df6023" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5df6023"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1.</span> The Principle of Non-contradiction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
The principle of non-contradiction is a law of logic:
</p>
<div class="info" id="org304ce36">
<p>
<b>The Principle of Non-Contradiction</b> <br />
A proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time in the same respect.
</p>

</div>

<p>
This is foundational to logical reasoning and coherent thought.
</p>

<p>
The principle&#x2013;sometimes called a <b>law</b>&#x2013;of non-contradiction tells us that
<i>there is no truth</i> is invalid, and it must be rejected. If we reject <i>there is
no truth</i>, then we are left with the principle that <b>there <span class="underline">must</span> be truth</b>.
</p>

<p>
This is comforting when we remember Jesus Christ claimed to be the Way, the Truth, and
the Light. The truth is something foundational and concrete.
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4e94997" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4e94997"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Truth is Absolute</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Let's try another statement, <b>proposition B</b>: <i>there is no absolute truth</i>. We can explore the
validity of <b>B</b> in much the same way as we did for <b>A</b>. We can ask if <b>B</b> is
absolutely true. If it is true&#x2013;as so many who would invoke proposition <b>B</b> would
like us to believe&#x2013;, then <b>B</b> has negated itself, again becoming absurd and
invalid. Now, not only can we conclude that <b>there must be truth</b>, but also that
<b>truth is absolute</b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga6a2ee3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga6a2ee3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
In addition to having shown that there must be truth and truth must be absolute,
we also have acquired the principle of non-contradiction. This is very
important, because it allows us to identify and reject ideas which are invalid
based on contradictions within the ideas themselves. I believe this is also a
tool for theology: something cannot be both true and false at the same time in
the realm of faith. Such a theological proposition would contradict itself, and
it would be invalid.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
I was quite happy to be an Evangelical Christian, and I certainly believed that
the Bible was the only infallible authority I needed. After all, it was through
the Scriptures prayer, and the testimony of a friend that I had my first
powerful encounter with God. What more did I need?
</p>

<p>
My travels had me in different Christian denominations. My start was in the
Assemblies of God, where I learned the basics of Who God is, and of His great
love for us. Then, I transitioned to Calvary Chapel, where I heard amazing
expository teaching with beautiful application of both Old Testament and New
Testament scriptures. In my military time and during engineering graduate
school, I also tried an Evangelical Presbyterian church, a few non-denominationa
churches, a Southern Baptist Church, a Missionary Church, and an Evangelical
Free church.
</p>

<p>
At a Presbyterian church, I remember sitting in a Sunday school class, in which
a young woman asked the pastor, "Pastor, I have a question I don't know how to
handle. It came from a Catholic friend, who asked, 'If the Catholic Church gave
us the Bible, why shouldn't the Catholic Church be able to interpret the
Bible?'"
</p>

<p>
I do not recall the pastor's example. It was not nearly as memorable or as
cogent as the young woman's question. I let the question go, and I didn't think
about it for about 4-5 years.
</p>

<p>
As time went on, I thought about this on occasion. I remember concluding to
myself that the ability to define Scriptures is greater than the ability to
interpret it. For example, if you don't like an undeniable interpretation of a
certain passage, why cannonize it as Scripture in the first place?
</p>

<p>
Later, I learned that the process by which the Bible developed. It is not as
clear-cut as many would like it to be. This process highlights the need for an
additional authority aside from the Bible to even have a Bible. Since the Bible
doesn't define itself, to recognize a certain set of scriptures as <i>the Bible</i>
requrires an additional authority. Additionally, from Christian antiquity to the
modern age, different Christian traditions follow different set of books as
their sacred scriptures: there is no uniform agreement about what is the
Bible. Any Christian who says "I have the true, infallible Bible in my hand, and
the others are incorrect," must explain how they know this is the correct Bible,
and how they are infallibly sure. They will no doubt fall back on some authority
that says this is the correct Bible, not that one. Furthermore, if that
authority has infallibly identified the correct Bible, then we have an
infallible authority <i>apart from</i> the Bible. Thus, the Bible cannot be the only
infallible authority for Christians.

<p>
The doctrine of <i>sola scriptura</i> is often understood as the belief that the
Bible is the only infallible authority for Christian faith and
practice. However, this position faces a significant challenge: in order to know
what constitutes the Bible, an external authority is required to delineate the
contents of Scripture. The Bible itself does not provide its own table of
contents. This means that, before one can appeal to the Bible as the sole
infallible authority, one must first rely on an authority to define what "the
Bible" actually is.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">
<p>
The doctrine of <i>sola scriptura</i> is often understood as the belief that the
Bible is the only infallible authority for Christian faith and
practice. However, this position is problematic because it presumes that the
Bible is self-defining—yet, the Bible does not contain its own <b>table of
contents</b>. Instead, the contents of Scripture were determined by an external
authority. The historical development of the Christian canon demonstrates that
the Church played a necessary and authoritative role in recognizing and defining
Scripture.
</p>

<p>
If we require another infallible authority to know what Scriptures are included
in the Bible, then the Bible cannot be the sole infallible authority for
Christian life and worship.

<li><a id="orgeaeaf01"></a>The Development of the Christian Scriptures<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-2-2-1">
<p>
The Bible as we know it today did not appear as a single, bound volume in the
early Church. Instead, the books of both the <b><b>Old Testament</b></b> and <b><b>New
Testament</b></b> were compiled over time, with different traditions preserving
different sets of books. The process of recognizing and defining Scripture was a
<b><b>complex, authoritative decision</b></b> rather than an automatic or universally
agreed-upon process. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b><b>Old Testament</b></b> consists of writings compiled over centuries, with
different groups accepting different books.</li>
<li>The <b><b>New Testament</b></b> was written in the first century, but disputes over
which books were authoritative continued for centuries.</li>
<li>Church councils (such as <b><b>Rome AD 382, Hippo AD 393, Carthage AD 397</b></b>)
played a key role in affirming the New Testament canon.</li>
<li>The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century led to a rejection of certain
Old Testament books previously accepted by Christians.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The very fact that <b><b>Christians today accept different canons</b></b> highlights the need for an external authority to determine which books belong in Scripture.

<p>
Many Protestant arguments claim that the Church merely "recognized" which books
were inspired, rather than defining them. However, this <b><b>does not solve the
problem of authority</b></b>: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The act of <b>recognition</b> itself requires <b><b>a group or council</b></b> to make
authoritative judgments.</li>
<li>Recognition relies on <b>criteria</b> such as <b><b>apostolic authorship</b></b>, yet these
criteria were **set by an authority**—not by Scripture itself.</li>
<li>The <b><b>different canons in use today</b></b> prove that the identification of inspired Scripture was not self-evident, but required a <b><b>teaching authority</b></b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a believer chooses a particular <b><b>canon of Scripture</b></b>, they are necessarily
submitting to <b><b>the authority that defined that canon</b></b>. If they claim their
canon is <b><b>infallibly correct</b></b>, then they implicitly grant <b><b>infallibility</b></b> to
the authority that established that canon. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org303f9ef"></a>Conclusion: The Limits of Sola Scriptura<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-2-2-4">
<p>
Given the historical development of the canon, the role of Church councils, and
the differences between Christian Bibles today, <b>sola scriptura</b> as an absolute
doctrine is untenable. The Bible is not a self-authenticating authority; its
very contents were **established by an external authority**—the Church. 
</p>

<p>
This means that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <b><b>canon of Scripture itself</b></b> is an extra-biblical tradition.</li>
<li>The process of <b><b>recognizing</b></b> Scripture requires an authority outside of
Scripture.</li>
<li>The differences in <b><b>Christian canons</b></b> today prove that an <b><b>authoritative
Church</b></b> is necessary to define Scripture.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thus, the claim that "the Bible alone is the only infallible authority" is
self-defeating. Without an infallible Church to define what belongs in the
Bible, one cannot even know <b><b>which Bible</b></b> to follow. The <b><b>authority of the
Church</b></b> is inescapable in the formation, recognition, and interpretation of
Scripture.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-4">
<p>
Given these historical realities, <code>sola scriptura</code> faces a serious problem: if
the Bible is the only infallible authority, how does one determine what
constitutes "the Bible" without appealing to an external authority? 
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org32d0f93"></a>1. The Necessity of an External Authority<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-3-4-1">
<p>
Without the Church's authority, one would have no objective way to know which books belong in the canon.
</p>

<p>
The early Church played a central role in collecting, preserving, and recognizing inspired writings.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org61b54c8"></a>2. The "Recognition" Argument Does Not Solve the Issue<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-3-4-2">
<p>
Some argue that the Church does not define Scripture but merely recognizes inspired writings.
</p>

<p>
However, recognition itself is an act of authority: it either relies on a group (e.g., bishops, Jewish scholars) or on a test (e.g., apostolic authorship).
</p>

<p>
If a test is used, then we depend on the authority of those who established that test.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgd40fe8b"></a>3. The Existence of Differing Canons Highlights the Problem<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-3-4-3">
<p>
If the Bible were self-evident in its contents, there would be no dispute over which books belong.
</p>

<p>
Yet, various Christian traditions hold different canons, meaning believers submit to an external authority in choosing the "correct" canon.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orge41c41e"></a>4. The Infallibility Problem<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-3-4-4">
<p>
If a believer holds that their canon is infallibly correct, then the authority that defined that canon must also be infallible.
</p>

<p>
This contradicts the claim that the Bible alone is the only infallible authority.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of <code>sola scriptura</code>, understood as the Bible being the sole infallible authority, is self-refuting. The very act of defining the Bible's contents requires an external authority. Since different Christian traditions accept different canons, the believer must ultimately submit to an authority beyond Scripture to determine what counts as Scripture in the first place. Thus, the role of the Church in establishing and identifying the Scriptures is indispensable, demonstrating that an authoritative, living tradition is necessary alongside the written Word of God.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
A dogma central to Luther's Protestant reformation is summarized by the phrase
<i>sola fide</i>, which is translated "by faith alone." This encapsulates the idea
that man is saved or <i>justified</i> in God's sight by faith alone.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is important to ask the question: can man be saved by faith alone?
</p>

<p>
If you wish, you may view a video I made on this very topic:
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBypIA26vTs?si=BejzbpaN9AkIwvbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
My conditioning to believe in <i>sola fide</i> was one of the major obstacles for me
to embracing Catholicism, even though I was already persuaded that <i>sola
scriptura</i> was not defensible, and I favored the Orthodox teaching of the Real
Presence of Christ in the Eucharist over the symbolist interpretation of some
Protestant groups.

<div id="outline-container-org3e0d353" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3e0d353"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> Evidence For <i>Sola Fide</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Many proponents of <i>sola fide</i> say that the Bible plainly states that man is
saved by faith alone in Ephesians 2:8-10:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing;
it is the gift of God— not the result of works, so that no one may boast
(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-10&amp;version=NRSVCE">Ephesians 2:8-10, NRSVCE</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This verse <i>excludes</i> works as a means of salvation, leaving only grace and
faith as causes of salvation. Thus, a <i>sola-fide</i> adherent will reason, no works
done by a human can earn their salvation, and only faith can save.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, additional verses support the exclusion of works as a means of
salvation:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A20&amp;version=NRSVCE">Romans 3:20 (NRSVCE)</a>

deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.

Because of verses such as these, proponents of <i>sola fide</i> support the dogma

insufficient in this view to <i>justify</i> humans&#x2013;that is, to qualify us for
salvation and an afterlife in the loving presence of God.

<p>
<b>Eternal Security or the Perseverance of the Saints</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
<i>Sola Fide</i> also leads to another dogma called <b>eternal security</b> or <b>the
perseverance of the saints</b>. Eternal security follows from <i>sola fide</i>, for since
one's works cannot contrubte to salvation, they cannot imperil one's
salvation. However, even in the Protestant world, there is poor agreement about
the perseverance of the saints: Calvinists and Baptitsts tend toward the
perseverance of the saints, but numerous Evangelical denominations follow the
Arminian tradition, which teaches that a Christian may lose his or her
salvation. From this, we can deduce that there is no Scripture that 
irrevocably establishes eternal security, or the debate would be laid to rest. 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, several passages of Scripture suggest that one can fall
away from salvation. At the very least, these Scriptures should indicate that
eternal security is not such a secure doctrine. Notable Scripture passages
include: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A1-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 13:1-23 (RSVCE)</a>: Here, Jesus gives the Parable of the Sower:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
3 Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to
sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and
the birds came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not
have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But
when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because
they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked
the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a
hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them
hear.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This left his audience, including his disciples puzzled. Later, He explained
it to His disciples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
18 “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 19 When anyone hears
the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes
and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along
the path. 20 The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the
word and at once receives it with joy. 21 But since they have no root, they
last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the
word, they quickly fall away. 22 The seed falling among the thorns refers to
someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the
deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. 23 But the seed
falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands
it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty
times what was sown.” 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For clarity, we pair each class of seed with the type of human heart:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Seed along the path illustrates people who do not grasp the
message about the kingdom of God.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parable text</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and
the birds came and ate it up.
</p>

<p>
<i>Explanation</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>

19 When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand
it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their

<li><p>
Seed in rocky places illustrates people who receive the message, but do
not persevere in it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parable text</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up
quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the
plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Explanation</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
20 The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word
and at once receives it with joy. 21 But since they have no root, they
last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the
word, they quickly fall away. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This raises some interesting questions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In the parable, "It sprang up quickly" is "someone who hears the word."
Did the person experience the life of Christ and then fall away? The
defender of eternal security would say they never were a believer in
the first place, but is that a sound interpretation? The defensor of
eternal security will say that it is sound, because it supports the
desired narrative and fits in with the interpretive lens of eternal
security. However, it appears that in contrast to the individual who
simply did not understand the message, this person actually did, and
this person bore evidence of the new life in Christ; and that this
person failed to persevere.</li>
<li>What does "fall away" mean? The eternal security ally would say that
such a person only looked like a genuine beleiver, but really wasn't in
the first place. But, how can one "fall away" if they were not first
connected to Christ in the first place?</li>
</ol>
<p>
The seed on rocky ground seems to represent individuals who fall away from
their salvation due to external pressures (trouble or persecution). For
simplicity, we may call this the <i>weak Christian</i>, since he cannot endure
the trouble or persecution.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Seed falling among thorns is paired with individuals who fail to persevere
due to a temporal, worldly perspective obscuring their perspective on
things eternal.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parable text</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Explanation</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
22 The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word,
but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the
word, making it unfruitful.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Like the weak Christian, this, worldly Christian exhibits the new life,
but fails to persevere. This new life is choked out (it could not be
choked out if it was not alive in the first place) because this new
believer is distracted from things eternal by things of the world.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Seed falling on good soil represents fruitful Christians.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parable text</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred,
sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Explanation</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
23 But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word
and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a
hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defender of eternal security may suggest that since the fruitful
Christian is described as one who hears and understands the message, the
weak Christian (group 2) and the worldly Christian (group 3) did not
understand the message and were not truly Christian in the first
place. However, since Christ spoke of this seed germinating and groups 2
and 3 also hearing, they have more in common with the fruitful Christian
(group 4) than group 1 (those who did not understand). It is more likely
that groups 2 and 3 really were Christians, and they understood the
message, but not to the same extent that the Christians of group 4
did. The fruitful Christians understood that Christ is their very life,
and they held on to the end; but groups 2 and 3 did not fully grasp this,
and they were persuaed by difficult external circumstances or a misguided
heart that to abandon Christ would be better than to endure.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The defender of eternal security may interpret this to be a warning
against fruitlessness rather than an indication about the loss of one's
salvation. Nonetheless, this indicates an individual can fall away from
Christ.
</p>

<p>
The next passage raises the stakes and gives a firm warning against
fruitlessness, indicating dire consequences for fruitlessness because of a
failure to abide in Christ.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A1-8&amp;version=RSVCE">John 15:1-8 (RSVCE)</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
15 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch of
mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear
fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 3 You are already made clean by
the word which I have spoken to you. 4 <b>Abide in me, and I in you.</b> As the
branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can
you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He who
abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me
you can do nothing. 6 <b>If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a
branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and
burned.</b> 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you
will, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this my Father is glorified, that
you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This passage is taken from St. John's narrative of the Last Supper, and
Jesus' disciples were present. These were His inner circle, the Twelve
Apostles. Jesus conditions the bearing of fruit with abiding in Him, and He
commands the Twelve to abide in Him. Several interesting questions arise
here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why would Jesus command the Twelve to abide in Him if it were impossible
for them to stop abiding in Him?</li>
<li>Why does Christ warn about <i>not abiding</i> in Him if it were impossible to
stop abiding in Him?</li>
<li>Furthermore, why would Jesus warn about the consequences of not abiding in
Him if it were impossible to stop abiding in Him?</li>
<li>What are the consequences of failing to abide in Jesus?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What does it mean to wither away?</li>
<li>How can a branch wither if it is not first a healthy part of the vine?</li>
<li>What does it mean for a withered branch to be burned in fire?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024%3A3-13&amp;version=RSVCE">Matthew 24:3-13 (RSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately,
saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming
and of the close of the age?” 4 And Jesus answered them, “*Take heed that no
one leads you astray*. 5 For  many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the
Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will hear of wars and
rumors of wars; see that you are not  alarmed; for this must take place, but
the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places:
8 all this is but the beginning of the sufferings.
</p>

<p>
9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and
you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then <b>many will
fall away</b>, and betray one another, and hate one another. 11 And many false
prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because wickedness is
multiplied, most men’s love will grow cold. 13 But <b>he who endures to the end 
will be saved</b>. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some key questions arise here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why would Jesus have warned His disciples of being led astray if that were
not possible?</li>
<li>Why would Christ have been warning about <span class="underline">falling away</span> if that were not
possible?</li>
<li>What does <i>falling away</i> mean? How can one <i>fall away</i> if they were never
joined to Christ in the first place?</li>
<li>Does verse 13 inicate that it is possible to fail to endure to the end?
This <span class="underline">does not</span> say <i>he who is saved endures to the end</i> (i.e., that
salvation determines endurace as in the Calvinist or Baptist
undrstanding), but rather that <i>endurace merits salvation</i>.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206%3A4-7&amp;version=RSVCE">Hebrews 6:4-7 (RSVCE)</a>. The writer describes individuals who have truly tasted
the heavenly gift and partaken of the Holy Spirit, and then fall away.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
4 For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those <span class="underline">who have once
been enlightened</span>, who <span class="underline">have tasted the heavenly gift</span>, and <b>have become
partakers of the Holy Spirit</b>, 5 and have <span class="underline">tasted the goodness of the word of
God and the powers of the age to come</span>, 6 if they then commit apostasy, since
they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to
contempt. 7 For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and
brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated,
receives a blessing from God. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a very interesting and powerful verse, for it speaks of those cannot
be <span class="underline">restored</span> <b>after</b> having become <span class="underline">partakers of the Holy Spirit</span>, having
<span class="underline">tasted of the goodness of God</span> and having come to <span class="underline">know the powers of the
age to come</span>.
</p>

<p>
Proponents of eternal security would attempt to argue that these individuals
only <i>appeared</i> to be saved, but it was the case that they were never saved
in the first place. Some have even suggested to me in dialog that these
people were not enlightened by the Holy Spirit, despite the fact that the
text says they were enlightened and partakers of the Holy Spirit before
needing an (impossible) restoration. It would be pointless to talk of
<i>restoration</i> if the person had not initially been in a state of grace.
</p>

<p>
Some have responded to this verse by saying that it's complex, unclear, and can be
interpreted in many ways. This response is not adequate, because it does not
suggest an interpretation that supports eternal security, but only attempts
to obscure a verse that reads in a simple way to cast <b>significant doubt</b>
upon eternal security.

Philippians 3:7-14 (RSVCE). St. Paul speaks of <span class="underline">not already having attained</span>
his goal, and not already having become perfected. He wanrs us to keep
striving, like he does, to attain the <span class="underline">resurrection from the dead</span>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed
I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count
them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not
having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through
faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith; 10 that I
may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings,
becoming like him in his death, 11 that if possible I may attain the
resurrection from the dead. 
</p>

<p>
12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on
to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13 Brethren, I
do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what
lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on toward the
goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Let those of us
who are mature be thus minded; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, God
will reveal that also to you. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A16-17&amp;version=RSVCE">1 John 5:16-17 (RSVCE)</a>. In verses 16-17, St. John speaks of mortal sin: "16 If any one sees
his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God will
give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is
mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin,
but there is sin which is not mortal." Protestant Bible translations tend to
render "mortal" as "sin leading to death". The important question is, what
does <i>mortal</i> mean? It is helpful to notice that the context of this verse is
in a discussion where St. John equates eternal life with a relationship with
the Son of God (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A11-13&amp;version=RSVCE">11-13</a>): to possess the Son of God is to have eternal life
(see also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A1-3&amp;version=RSVCE">John 17:1-3</a>, where eternal life is equated with <b>knowing Jesus and
the Father Who sent Him</b>). What, then, is death? It the opposite of being in
relationship with and posessing the Son of God and having eternal life: it is
separation from the Son of God, and being bereft of eternal life. Thus,
commiting mortal sin is the tearing away of oneself from union with God, and
thus the loss of eternal life.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is <span class="underline">not</span> that life is given to us in an eternal (timeless) and
irrevocable manner; rather, eternity is a quality of the life that is given
to us, and this life is none other than Jesus. We still have the opportunity
to fail to abide in that life, and by our mortal sin to reject this life,
which is eternal. In other words, <i>eternal</i> does not describe the way in
which the life is given; rather, it describes the life itself, which is
Jesus, Who is eternal. Nowhere in the Scriptures nor the tradition which gave
us the Scripture does it say that our relationship with Christ is unbreakable
by our own high-handed disobedience. Rather, we are left with a significant
corpus of Scripture and tradition that indicates that our relationship with
Christ can be lost through mortal sin or apostasy.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Catholic Answers has an excellent article: <a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#">What the Early Church Believed:
Mortal Sin</a>. This provides important context, because in the case of the Didache,
these authors wrote the Scriptures (in the case of the Didache), or played
important roles in the establishing of the Canon of Scripture identified in the
late 4th Century.
</p>

<p>
Additional Scriptures that proponents of eternal security use as "proof texts"
for this dogma include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A27-30&amp;version=RSVCE">John 10:27-30 (RSVCE)</a>. "27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they
follow me; 28 and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and
no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to
me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the
Father’s hand." Proponents of eternal security may argue that if one could
lose his salvation, then that life is not eternal. Or, they may point to the
statement that no one may be snatched from the saving hand of Christ or God
the Father.
</p>

<p>
While this passage clearly teaches that a person's salvation cannot be
disrupted by a third party, it <span class="underline">does not</span> clearly refute the idea that a
person could walk away from their own salvation, that is to willingly crawl
out of the saving hand of God. This possibility is left open.
</p>

<p>
Another interpretation is that the eternal life given is in fact not eternal
if it can be lost. We have already dealt with this point above, where we
discuss John's own understanding of eternal ife as relationship with Jesus,
for Jesus Himself is our life. <i>Eternal life</i> does not necessarily mean that
life is given eternally, but that the life (Jesus) which is given to us is
eternal. Other Scriptures (discussed above) leave open the possibiltiy of
severing our relationship with Christ through mortal sin or failing to bear
fruit.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010%3A14&amp;version=RSVCE">Hebrews 10:14 (RSVCE)</a>. "14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all
time those who are sanctified."
</p>

<p>
Proponents of eternal security suggest that this past-tense language of
having perfected believing Christians once and for all, so that salvation is
a "one and done" deal. Yet, when read in context, this passage is not about
eternal security. Hebrews 10 compares the sacrifice of Christ to the animal
sacrifices of the old covenant. The animal sacrifices had to be repeated on a
yearly basis, and it could not actually absolve sins; Christ's sacrifice
occured only once, and it is done and efficacious for saving Christians.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, St. Paul speaks of <i>not being perfected yet</i> in Philippians 3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
8 Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all
things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be
found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that
which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on
faith; 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may
share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that <i>if possible I
may attain the resurrection from the dead</i>.
</p>

<p>
12 <span class="underline">Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect</span>; but I press
on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13
Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do,
forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I
press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>
In summary, the challenges to eternal security are great. While some passages
even suggest that salvation can be lost, no passage decisively says that a
Christian cannot reject his salvation. Based on the lack of evidence for eternal
security, it seems very difficult to defend the concept.
</p>

<p>
At this point, as so many doctrinal discussions do, it comes down to
interpretations. The Baptist/Calvinist interpretation is for eternal security;
the Arminian interpretation is against eternal security. Under the dogma of
<i>sola scriptura</i>, there is no resolution here, or it would have been resolved
hundreds of years ago. Fortunately, Christ did not leave us with <i>sola
scriptura</i> and only the Scriptures to detetermine our doctrine infallibly; He
gave us a Church, and instructed us to hand down the faith through Her teaching
(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A16-20&amp;version=RSVCE">Matthew 28:16-20</a>). This was the very Church that raised up disciples and martyrs, endured
persecution, and after hundreds of years, identified the Scriptures as those
writings which could be read in the liturgy. The Church has the testimony of the
authors of scripture, as well as the testimony of those Christians to whom the
Scriptures were written. Eternal security was not part of Christian teaching
historically and only emerged within the context of the Protestant Reformation
with the likes of John Calvin.

<b>The Origin of the Protestant Doctrine of Eternal Security</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
The dogma of <b>eternal security*—the belief that a person who is truly saved
cannot lose their salvation—did not exist as a formalized doctrine in the
earliest centuries of Christianity. It developed over time, with its clearest
articulation emerging during the *Protestant Reformation</b>, particularly in
<b>Calvinist theology</b> in the 16th century.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Historical Development</span>:
</p>

<p>
<i>Early Christianity (1st–5th centuries)</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius of Antioch, Origen, Tertullian,
Augustine) generally believed that salvation could be lost through serious sin
or apostasy.</li>
<li>The Christian life was seen as a process requiring perseverance; passages like
Hebrews 6:4–6 and Matthew 24:13 were interpreted to mean believers must remain
faithful to the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Medieval Period (5th–15th centuries)</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Western Church (later Roman Catholic) maintained that <b>grace can be
lost</b> through mortal sin, but restored through repentance and the sacraments
(especially confession).</li>
<li>No concept resembling "once saved, always saved" was part of official doctrine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Protestant Reformation (16th century)</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Martin Luther</b> taught justification by faith alone, but did not emphasize
eternal security in the Calvinist sense.</li>
<li><b>John Calvin</b> developed the doctrine of the *perseverance of the saints*—-a core
part of his theology (TULIP). He taught that those whom God elects will
inevitably persevere in faith and cannot fall away.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is the clearest root of the modern doctrine of <b>eternal security</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Other Reformers</b> (like the Anabaptists and later Arminians) rejected this and
emphasized the possibility of falling from grace.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Post-Reformation and Evangelical Movements</i>:

<p>
Proponents of <i>sola fide</i> also may make a distinction between justification and
sanctification. Justification is a process by which a human is declared
righteous and qualified for salvation, despite personal flaws and moral
imperfection. Justification is believed by <i>sola-fide</i>-ists to be independent of
works, but sanctification&#x2013;the process of becoming holy and Christ-like&#x2013;is not
necessary for salvation.
</p>

<p>
In view of the fact that salvation (justification) is by faith alone through
grace alone, another belief is common among proponents of <i>sola fide</i>: that the
Gospel (Good News of salvation) depends on faith, not works; and, anyone who
trust in anything else for salvation apart from faith is condemned. This is
directly supported by a verse from Paul the Apostle in the <i>Epistle to the
Galatians</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus
Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified! 2 The only thing I want to learn
from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by
believing what you heard? 3 Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit,
are you now ending with the flesh? 4 Did you experience so much for nothing?—if
it really was for nothing. 5 Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit
and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your
believing what you heard? 
</p>

<p>
Just as Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” 
so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham. And the
scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the
gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the Gentiles shall be blessed in
you.” For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who
believed. 
</p>

<p>
For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is
written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
written in the book of the law.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
before God by the law; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[b] 12
But the law does not rest on faith; oMn the contrary, “Whoever does the works of
the law will live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a
tree”— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to
the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

<h3 id="orgfee1007"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Evidence Against <i>Sola Fide</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
The first and most importnat an important piece of evidence against <i>sola fide</i>
is found in the body of Scripture itself:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You see that a person is <b>justified by works</b> and <b>not by faith alone</b>. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A24&amp;version=NRSVCE">James 2:24
(NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interestingly, this is the <b>only place</b> in <i>all of the Christian Scriptures</i> where
the "faith alone" is used, and it clearly states that salvation is <b>not</b> by
faith alone, but rather, <b>works play a role in justification</b>.
</p>

<p>
At its very best, <i>sola fide</i> is not scriptural, but rather <b>antiscriptural</b>,
that is, contrary to the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
The Gospel is <b>not</b> that man is saved by grace alone through faith alone.
</p>

<p>
How can we balance James with the Scriptures mentioned above that indicate works
do not save a person? The Catholic response is that the preponderance of the
above works do not speak about <span class="underline">works in general</span> as being ineffectual, but
rather the <b>works of the law</b> are ineffectual. What are the works of the law?
These are <b>circumcision, animal sacrifices, etc</b>. It is these works of the law
that are inneffectual for salvation, but good works done in <i>charity</i> are in fact
meritorious for salvation.
</p>

<p>
In fact, let us review the above passges and highlight the concept of the <b>works
of the law</b> in them:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>

Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing
the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the <span class="underline">works of the

</p>

<p>

</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, we can see the importance of works for salvation. We start with the words
of Jesus, where he speaks of the judgement of the righteous unto eternal life,
and the unrighteous to damnation, where righteousness is tied to a person's
<i>works</i>: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will
sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and
he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 
</p>

<p>
34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by
my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the
creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I
was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited
me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after
me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’ 
</p>

<p>
37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and
feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a
stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we
see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ 
</p>

<p>
40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the
least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ 
</p>

<p>
41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed,
into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry
and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did
not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’ 
</p>

<p>
44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a
stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’
</p>

<p>
45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the
least of these, you did not do for me.’
</p>

<p>
46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal
life."
</p>

<p>
(Matthew 15:31-46 NIV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
St. Paul also indicates that a person must work toward salvation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much
more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for
it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure." 
(Philippians 2:12-13 NIV).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Additionally, John speaks of the judgment of all the dead:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and
the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12 And I
saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged
according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13 The sea gave up the
dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them,
and each person was judged according to what they had done. 14 Then death and
Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second
death. 15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown
into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15, NIV)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Understanding the Eucharist&#x2013;that is, the elements of Communion&#x2013;is perhaps the
most important key to understanding the Catholic Mass and the Catholic
worldview. Common among the apostolic Christians is that Jesus Christ is truly
present in the elements of Communion, called the Eucharist in the Catholic
Church. By <i>apostolic Christians</i>, we mean the Christian churches established
throughout the centuries <i>prior</i> to the Protestant Reformation, such as the
Armenians, the Copts, the Greek Orthodox, the Russian Orthodox, etc.
</p>


<div id="org782eb80" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Catholics and generally all ancient apostolic Christians sects founded prior to the Protestant Reformation accept the teaching that the Eucharist (the elements of Communion) truly are the flesh and blood of Christ. This teaching is derived from the teachings of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-71&amp;version=RSVCE">John 6:22-71 RSVCE</a>, the writings of St. Paul, the earliest believers&#x2013;such as St. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John the Evangelist (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">Epistle to the Smyrnaeans</a>, ch. 6-7), and numerous <a href="https://www.churchfathers.org/the-real-presence">church fathers</a>. Additionally, several Protestant founders such as <a href="https://www.detroitcatholic.com/voices/luther-s-defense-of-the-real-presence-in-the-eucharist">Martin Luther</a>, John Calvin, and others upheld the teaching of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</p>
</div>


<p>
Tthe belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the elements of the
Eucharist. This concept also is referred to the <i>Real Presence</i> of Christ in the
Eucharist, and the specific version of the Real Presence taught by the Catholic
church involves <i>transubstantiation</i>.
</p>

<p>
Transubstantiation means that what looks like bread is God. At some point, it
was made as bread. It has all the outward appearances (technically, called the
<i>accidents</i>) of bread, and in its essence or <i>substance</i>, it is bread. However,
at the words of consecration ("This is my body" or "This is the cup of my
blood"), bread and wine are changed in substance from bread and wine to the very
flesh and blood of God.
</p>

<p>
For apostolic Christians, this means that being in the presence of the Eucharist
is a very holy occasion, since it is the very presence of Jesus Christ, the
living God. This makes such occasions every bit as holy as the encounter Moses
had with the burning bush:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the
mountain of God. 2 And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire
from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with
fire, but the bush was not consumed. 3 Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside
and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.” 
</p>

<p>
4 So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the
midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” 
</p>

<p>
And he said, “Here I am.”
</p>

<p>
5 Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet,
for the place where you stand is holy ground.” 6 Moreover He said, “I am the God
of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

<h3 id="orgd724433"><span class="section-number-3">5.3.</span> The Mass as an Intimate Dance with God</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
Because of the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the Mass provides a real
and intimate way for us to have contact with our Lord. I like to think of it as
an intimate dance with the Divine, or perhaps as a call and response between a
Divne lover, and me, His beloved.
</p>

<p>
The Mass can be divided roughly into two parts: the liturgy of the Word, and the
liturgy of the Eucharist. We can think of the liturgy of the Word as God's
divine call to us, and the liturgy of the Eucharist as our human response to
God's call.
</p>

<p>
The liturgy of the Word  contains the introductory rites and readings of
Scripture. It culminates with a reading from the Gospel, for which we stand in
honor of Jesus, acknowledging His presence (non-Eucharistic) in the reading of
the Gospels (the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The 
ligurgy of the Word then typically concludes 
with a homily, in which the priest helps us connect the readings with our
present lives and draws on how we may apply the Word of God personally
today. Depending on the day of the week or the liturgical calendar, there may be
a profession of the Nicene creed. This completes the divine call in the Liturgy
of the Word.
</p>

<div class="info" id="orgea6b2ec">
<p>
<b>The Word of God</b>
</p>

<p>
The <b>word of God</b> is typically interpreted in two ways: (1) as either Scriptures
(writings) or a spoken word, or (2) as Jesus Christ Himself.
</p>

<p>
Christians consider the Scriptures to be the divinely-inspired Word of God in written form. Here, when
you see <i>Word</i>, think <i>revelation</i> of God. The fullest revelation of God is
Jesus Christ, God in human form. See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1-18&amp;version=RSVCE">John 1:1-18</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A1-3&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, Hebrews 4:12 is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as a reference
to the Bible. A close reading of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A12-13&amp;version=RSVCE">Hebrews 4:12-13</a> reveals that Jesus is the subject
here, not a collection of writings:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword,
piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And before him no
creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom
we have to do. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In verse 12, the English "word" is λόγος (<i>logos</i>) in the Greek, and this is
these same λόγος as in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&amp;version=RSVCE">John 1:1</a>, which is none other than Jesus Christ, our
Lord.  Additionally, verse 13 uses the pronoun <i>him</i>, referring back to the
previous subject, the λόγος of God.
</p>

</div>

<p>
After the homily, we transition to the liturgy of the Eucharist. The climax of
the liturgy of the Eucharist is when the priest consecrates the bread and wine,
transforming it to the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, followed by the personal
reception of the Body and Blood by the Catholic faithful. When receiving the
Eucharist, we are declaring with our actions that we believe in all the
teachings of the Catholic Church, and we are offering ourselves to God, just as
He offers Himself to us in the Eucharist. We highlight several
parts of the liturgy of the Eucharist::
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It may begin with a period of <i>intercession</i>, where the church prays together
for various needs.</li>
<li>Then, there will be an offering of the people (an offering collection plate
or basket is passed around), and the bread and wine that will become the Body
and Blood of Jesus at the <i>Consecration</i>.  The bread and wine also are
regarded as <i>gifts</i> from the faithful</li>
<li>The priest then prepares the gifts to serve as the offering. He says prayers
for himself and the people and the church.</li>
<li>Finally, when the altar is prepared, the priest invites us to pray with him
for what will become a sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood in Eucharistic
form to God. We stand and respond in prayer, finally concluding with "Holy,
Holy, Holy, is the Lord God almighty. Heaven and earth are full of Your
glory. Hosana in the highest. Hosana in the highest." Then, we kneel as the
priest undrtakes the holiest part of the Mass, the Consecration of the gifts.</li>
<li><p>
The Consecration begins with prayers by the priest. He shows the bread to the
faithful and recites teh words of Jesus, bowing. WHen says, "This is my
Body," we believe that the Holy Spirit works through the priest to
transubstantiate the bread: it is no longer bread, but God Himself, in His
fullness&#x2013;Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. The consecration of the bread is
followed by the priest elevating the Body of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the priest consecrates the wine with the words of Jesus, "&#x2026; this
is the chalice of my blood &#x2026;", followed by an elevation.
</p></li>
<li>Next, we pray the Lord's prayer, inviting God to be Lord of our lives with
the words, "&#x2026;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done&#x2026;"</li>
<li><p>
Following this, the Catholic faithful are invited to receive the Body and
Blood of Christ. This is the most intimate interaction we can have with God
in this present life, and far more intimate than any act of intimacy we can
perform with another human.
</p>

<p>
Non-Catholics and Catholics not properly prepared to receive the Eucharist
also may approach, but they should not receive. Catholics and 
non-Catholics alike can indicate their intention <b>not to receive</b> by crossing
their arms in front of their chest. The priest or Eucharistic minister will
then give a blessing. I recommend non-Catholics and unprepared Catholics
still approach the priest or Eucharistic minister, since this allows a better
flow of people. The faithful return to their pews and kneel reverently in
prayer of thanksgiving for the great and intimate gift of Christ's Body that
He himself gives us.
</p></li>
<li>The priest will then cleanse the sacred vessels, give closing prayers and a
blessing, and dismiss the Mass with the words, "Mass is ended. Go in peace."</li>

<p>
The Catholic teaching is that the Mass is a holy sacrifice. Actually, it is
two-fold. One sacrifice is by the priest, who sacrifices the Body and Blood of Jesus to God the Father on
behalf of the Church. The other sacrifice is that of the lay faithful, who
present their bodies to God as a living offering, in accordance with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A1-2&amp;version=NKJV">Romans

<p>
The <b>Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</b>, often abbreviated to the <i>Real
Presence</i>, is the teaching or belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the
elements of Communion. This is to be contrasted with a more symbolist view,
which was first espoused by Ulrich Zwingli in the first Zurich disputation
(January 1523). Today, many more evangelical Protestant denominations hold to
the Zwinglian symbolist view. However, the Real Presence has been the view
upheld by Church fathers since the writing of the Gospels, the early decades of
the Church, and down through the centuries. It is so prevalent that all
apostolic Christian churches&#x2013;those churches established prior to the Protestant
Reformation, such as the Armenians, the Copts, the Chaldeans, the Greek
Orthodox, Ethiopean Orthodox, etc.&#x2013;all uphold the Real Presence in a corporeal
sense. Additionally, Martin Luther himself upheld the Real Presence in debate
against Zwingli's symbolist position. John Calvin and John Wesley are other
notable Protestant leaders and founders who believed in and taught a form of the
Real Presence, though they espoused a more spiritual version of the Real
Presence. Zwingli's symbolist view emerged as a significant unorthodox
theological novelty after the Real Presence dominated Chistian thought and 
teaching for the first 16 centuries of Christianity. In the symbolist view, the
Real Presence is rejected, and communion is simply a rememberance of Christ's
passion.

<p>
<b>The Real Presence and Transubstantiation</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>More information ...</summary>

<p>
The Real Presence refers to the teaching that Christ is truly present in the
elements of Communion of which we as Christians partake. The Catholic teaching
is a <i>corporeal</i> real presence, since the Catholic Church teaches that the
Eucharist is Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. In particular, the Catholic
teaching is called <b>transubstantiation</b>. This means that the <i>substance</i> or
<i>essence</i> of the elements of communion&#x2013;that is, what they <span class="underline">are</span>&#x2013;has been
changed from the substance of bread and wine to the substance of God Himself in
the Second Person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ. The bread and wine are gone, and
all that is present is Jesus Christ Himself, even though the Eucharist retains the
<i>accidents</i> of bread and wine. <i>Accidents</i> are those properties that can be
physically experienced, measured, or observed. Thus according to the doctrine of
transubstantiation, we can never tell from appearances or even intense study
that the Eucharist is anything other than Bread and Wine; however, because of
the testimony of Jesus Christ Himself, we receive by faith that the Eucharist is
actually Christ. Additionally, the Eucharist is not a part of Christ (not a
finger or a piece of skin or a portion of liver); rather it is <i>all</i> of Christ
in a non-extensible way. By non-extensible, we mean that if we receive two
Eucharistic hosts, we do not receive twice as much of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Within Christianity, a broad range of views pertaining to the Real Presence
persist. Here is a brief listing of some various non-Catholic views:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Eastern Orthodoxy. Eastern Orthodox churches share a similar belief in the
real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but they do not use the term
"transubstantiation" and do not explicitly define the manner of the change.</li>
<li>Lutheranism. Lutherans believe in the consubstantiation, where Christ's body
and blood are present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine.</li>
<li>Anglicanism. Anglicans have a wide range of views, from a spiritual presence
to a corporeal presence (similar to Catholicism), with some emphasizing the
real presence as a mystery.</li>
<li>Reformed/Calvinistic Churches. Reformed Christians, including Presbyterian
and Reformed Baptist denominations, believe in a real, but spiritual presence
of Christ in the Eucharist.</li>
<li>Methodism. Methodists generally hold a Reformed view, believing in a real,
spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</li>
<li>Anabaptists, Plymouth Brethren, and some non-denominational Christian
churches. These groups tend to interpret the Eucharist as a symbolic
remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.</li>

<h3 id="orgeb8d525"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Scriptural Basis for the Real Presence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
Belief in the Real Presence comes from the teachings of Jesus Himself, with
confirmation by St. Paul. Starting with Jesus, He teaches in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-69&amp;version=ESV">John 6:22-69 (ESV)</a>
that He would give believers His flesh and blood to eat and drink. When this
repulsed His audence, He admitted this was a hard saying. Jesus didn't say
they misunderstood Him, nor did he indicate that He was being symbolic. In fact,
many of His followers left Him over this. Jesus let them go and asked the Twelve
Apostles if they, too, were going to leave Him.  He even used graphic Greek to say that His disciples should
<i>chew on</i> or <i>gnaw on</i> His flesh. Later, at the Last Supper, this is what Jesus
said to His disciples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave
it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” 
</p>

<p>
27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink
from it, all of you. 28 For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is
shed for many for the remission of sins.

<b>Figurative, or Literal? Does it even matter?</b>
</p>

<p>
Some protest that it's not clear whether Christ was being figurative or
literal. It is common to suggest that where the Bible leaves room for
interpretation, the doctrine in question doesn't matter, since it doesn't
pertain to salvation.
</p>

<p>
There are a few issues with this line of thinking.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Christ does not appear to think this issue is insignificant. Jesus would be
rather uncaring if He allowed most of His disciples to leave Him over an
issue that didn't matter. He simply could have said, "Come on, guys. You
don't have to go. It doesn't really matter whether you think I was being
figurative or literal.  You're abandoning the very source of all life itself
over a small matter."</li>
<li>There is no good mechanism for deciding which issues are central or essential
to the Christian faith if all you have is personal interpretations according
to <i>sola scriptura</i>. Some Christians think you have to be baptized to be
save, while others do not; some think drinking alcohol is a grave sin, and
others do not.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since Christ Himself appears to believe that it is important for His disciples
to eat His flesh and drink His blood, it should be important to us to determine
whether He is speaking figuratively or literally. Fortunately, <i>there is</i> a way
to do this.
</p>
</details>

</div>


<p>
St. Paul's retelling of the Last Supper also says Jesus told His disciples to
eat of His body:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the
Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; 24 and when He
had given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat; this is My body which is
broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 25 In the same manner He also
took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My
blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” 
</p>

<p>
26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord’s death till He comes.

<p>
<b>When Interpretations Conflict</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>More information ...</summary>

<p>
How can a matter be settled when interpretations conflict? A Catholic may read
John 6 and say, "It is clear that this speaks fo the Real Presence in the
Eucharist." On the other hand, a symbolist may say, "No, it isn't that
clear. There is great reason to believe that Jesus is speaking figuratively."
</p>

<p>
In this case, the dispute is a matter of conflicting interpretations. If
Scripture alone is our ultimate infallible authority, as adherents to the <i>Sola
Scriptura</i> often assert, there is no resolution when two individuals have
conflicting interpretations of the Scriptures. Each man is certain and correct,
because that is what the Holy Spirit spoke to him through the Holy
Scriptures. When interpretations are in direct contradiction, both cannot be
true at the same time according to the logical principle of non-contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Is there any force that can break the stalemate? If the two parties can suspend
their belief in <i>Sola Scriptura</i> momentarily, they may find that indeed, there
are voices and authorities that can help arbitrate between interpretations: the
early Church fathers! Their voices are particularly important because in many
cases, they lived and wrote within living memory of Christ and His
Apostles. Some of them were pupils of the Apostles and Gospel-writers
themselves. Surely they can help us understand, for example, whether St. John
was capturing Christ's Bread of Life Discourse (John 6) as a literal teaching or
as a more figurative parable.
</p>

<p>
An examplar of this is St. Ignatius of Antioch. He was a pupil of St. John, and
his writings reflect a position well within one camp of the Real-vs-Symbolist
debate to the exclusion of the other. Who better to help us understand whether
St. John intended for us to take Christ's teaching figuratively or literally?
St. Ignatius' testimony is discussed in the next section.

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Ignatius of Antioch is an important voice who helps us understand St. John's intent in writing John 6. Ignatius was a student of John himself.

</div>

<p>
The doctrine of the Real Presence also comes with some important historical
evidence. Since John the Evangelist wrote John 6, one of John's students,
Ignatius of Antioch writes clearly about his interpretation of John's work: he
interpret's his teacher's writing in John 6 to be <i>literal</i>, not merely
symbolic. Here is what Ignatius writes about the Real Presence:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect to the grace of
Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God. They
have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed;
of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.
</p>

<p>
They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the
Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our
sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore,
who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes.
</p>

<p>
(Ignatius of Antioch, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">Epistle to the Smyrneans</a>, Chapters 6-7, 106 AD (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">link</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ignatius' view aligns with a literal understanding of the Bread of Life
Discourse. It is natural to conclude that his view aligns with a literal reading
of his mentor's Gospel because that is the view his mentor taught him to
take. Notably, the epistle quoted above was written within 10 years of the death
of his teacher, and within a few decades of the time when St. John wrote the
<i>Revelation</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another important early source is by Justin Martyr (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm">First Apology</a>, chapter
66). Justin writes of the Eucharist:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And this food is called among us Εὐχαριστία [the Eucharist], of which no one is
allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are
true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of
sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For
<b>not as common bread and common drink</b> do we receive these; but in like manner as
Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both
flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food
which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh
by transmutation are nourished, <b>is the flesh and blood of that Jesus</b> who was
made flesh.

Satanists hate Christ, and they steal the consecrated Eucharist from Catholic
Churches because they, too, believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the
Eucharist. Note that they do not steal bread from Protestant demonmations
because they know that is merely symbolic. Once stolen, Satanists have Black
Mass ceremonies at which they attempt to torture, profane, and desecrate the
Body of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Below is a video of a recent attempted Black Mass in Topeak, Kanasas. Just prior
to the desecration, a Catholic man intervened and ate the host. It is not fully
known whether the host was consecrated (actually the Eucharist) or
pre-consecrated (only bread). The Satanists claimed that it was not consecrated,
and that the host was procured legally; however, what people say is not always
true.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
Protestants may feel that the Catholic Church observes and practices idolatry
through either veneration or or prayers to Mary, the angels, and the saints.
</p>

<p>
There really are two very serious questions here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Is prayer to beings other than God idolatry?</li>
<li>Is the respect shown by Catholics to beings other than God idolatry?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let's discuss these each in turn.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc817628" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc817628"><span class="section-number-4">7.1.1.</span> Prayer to Beings Other than God</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-1">
<p>
To understand this, we must first understand what prayer is. One perspective
non-Catholics may have is that prayer is communication with God, either
silently, or mentally. Therefore, if someone prays to a being other than God,
the supplicant is in a way deifying that non-divine being.
</p>

<p>
If that is what Catholics mean by praying to a non-divine being, then, I, too, 
would object, declare it idolatrous, and I would agree that it should be
avoided. However, this is not what Catholics mean in praying to Mary, other
saints, and angels. 
</p>

<p>
The English word "pray" comes from the Latin <i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precor">precor</a></i>, which means to beseech,
beg, pray, entreat, supplicate, or request. This term is <i>broader</i> than the
modern English use of "pray." In praying to Mary, other saints, and the angles,
Catholics are asking these individuals to pray for us, in the same way that we
ask another living human being to pray for us. Our prayer to non-divine entities
does not deify them, but simply makes a request of them. What request is that?
Their intercession.
</p>

<div class="info" id="org2b40b29">
<p>
<b>Modern and Old English Usage of "Pray"</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>

<p>
In older English, the term was more widely used to denote a request. For example, in <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/shakescleare/shakespeare-translations/romeo-and-juliet/act-4-scene-3#:~:text=But%2C%20gentle%20Nurse%2C%20I%20pray,cross%20and%20full%20of%20sin.">Act 4, Scene 3</a> of
Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Juliet asks her nurse to leave her alone:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself tonight,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although Juliet uses the word "pray," she is in no way deifying her nurse, nor
committing idolatry.
</p>

<p>
"Pray" also is <a href="https://www.lsd.law/define/pray">used in courtrooms</a> with this more archaic sense as a formal,
legal request.
</p>
</details>

</div>


<p>
The next natural question is whether it is valid to make requests for
intercession of holy, deceased individuals in heaven. Some say that there is no
scriptural precedent for this, so it should not be practiced.

<h4 id="org5aa6056"><span class="section-number-4">7.1.2.</span> Veneration of Mary and the Saints</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-2">
<p>
Catholics hold St. Mary, the other saints, and the angels in high regard. Is
this veneration idolatrous?
</p>

<p>
To understand this, we must understand what idolatry is and how Catholics relate
to these non-divine beings.
</p>

<p>
Idolatry may be defined as worship of another being aside from God. More
practically, it can be understood as the love of a material or created good more
than we love God. There are many material goods we make into idols, but the
often reduce to one of four things: power, pleasure, honor, or wealth. We will
deal here mostly with the worship of beings other than God, though enslavement
to other idols is a concern and separate topic initself.
</p>

<p>
The Catholic understanding of God is that God defines in a category by
Himself. He is infinite, immaterial, and eternal. He is without cause, and we
say God is being itself. There is no existence apart from God. Since God is
immaterial, He has no physical body and is not constrained by the material
universe, and so no image can be made of Him. God is being itself, and, within
Christian revelation, God is three Persons who share in the Divine nature: God
the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Yet, the eternal God has made an
image of Himself for us: Jesus Christ, in which this Divine Person has united a
human nature to His Divine nature in a mysterious way. He fully shares in
Divinity and its eternal nature, and He fully shares in a human nature. It is
possilbe to say that Jesus Christ is eternal in His divine nature, although His
human nature had a beginning and thus is not eternal.

<b>What is God?</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>


<p>
To learn what God is like, we can look to the universe. We can argue the
following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Anything that has a beginning has a cause.</li>
<li>The universe has a beginning.
There are two ways to support this:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Using evidence from science.</li>
<li>Using reason alone.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If the universe has no beginning, it would have endured for an infinite
amount of time to arrive at the present.</li>
<li>It is impossible to traverse an infinite period of time to arrive at the</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Thus, the universe has a cause.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It turns out that the universe has plenty to tell us about its cause. The
universe contains all matter, energy, space, and time&#x2013;or else it wouldn't be
the universe. Since the universe contains all matter, energy, space and time,
its cause must be independent of each of these. In other words, the cause of the
universe must be immaterial (independent of matter, energy, and space) as well
as eternal (independent or outside of time). At this point, the cause of the
universe begins to match the characteristic of the entity Christians and
adherents of other faiths call <i>God</i>. And since this cause of the universe is
outside of space and time, we can say that it is unchanging, for without time,
there is no change.
</p>

<p>
What we have learned about the cause of the universe appears to be lacking some
features of what Christians call God. In particular, the universe does not
immediately indicate that its cause has a personality. That is, we have not yet
established that the cause of the universe is a <i>personal</i> entity.
</p>

<p>
Now, we may ask, what could cause the unchanging cause of the universe to create
the universe? If the cause of the universe is unchanging, then nothing could
make it create a universe. However, such an all-powerful entity <i>chose</i>
to create out of its own free will. To posess a will and the faculty of choice
could explain the creation of the universe. For the cause of the universe to
have free will and choice implies personhood or personality within this
immaterial and eternal cause.

<details>
<summary>Read more (Really? Are you even Christian?) ...</summary>

<p>
I declare it's true: God does not exist.
</p>

<p>
To understand this, we must understand what <i>exist</i> means. The word "exist"
comes from Latin: <i>ex</i> means "from, out, outside of," and "ist" comes from <i>sistere</i>,
which means "to set up, to cause to stand." Thus, for something to <i>exist</i>
conveys the sense that it arises from something else.
</p>

<p>
While the universe is contingent upon its cause&#x2013;and as Christians, we believe
that cause to be God&#x2013;God is not existent in the sense that His being arises
from something else. Thus, I claim that <b>God does not exist</b>.
</p>

<p>
Rather, the fullness of teaching about God is that <b>God is being itself</b>. This
concept says that God is the fundamental source and essence of
existence. Anything that exists does so by sharing in God's being. If God ceased
to be, then everything that exists ceases to exist, also.
</p>

<p>
This concept of God as being itself aligns with God's self-identification as "I
AM" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A14&amp;version=RSVCE">Exodus 3:14</a>; and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A58-59&amp;version=RSVCE">John 8:58-59</a>). He is not from someone or something else;
God simply <i>is</i>.
</p>

<details>

</div>

<p>
Apart from God, there is no one who is eternal. The angels were created by God,
and so they are in no way equal to God. Even Satan himself is a created being,
and he exists because God wills his existence. Not even St. Mary herself
partakes of the eternal and divine nature. St. Mary had a beginning, and so she
is not eternal. Mary does not share in the divine nature.
</p>

<p>
With a proper understanding of God's divine nature&#x2013;to the extent that we can
understand it&#x2013; and an understanding of the relationship between this divine
nature and the human nature (or the angelic nature, for that matter), it becomes
impossible to think of any created being as an entity on par with, much less
greater than God. Thus, it becomes impossible to venerate a created being in any
way that rivals our veneration and worship of God.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Catholics do not worship anyone or anything apart from God. In
Catholicism, <i>worship</i> requires sacrifice, and the highest sacrifice is the very
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ (the Eucharist). Thus, the Catholic Mass (or
Orthodox Divine Liturgies) are the ultimate Sacrifice of God to God. Orthodox or
apostolic Christians&#x2013;including Catholics&#x2013;offer the Mass to no one other than
God. St. Mary is not worthy of the Sacrifice of the Mass. Thus, we worship God
alone.
</p>

<p>
In Catholic teaching, we give only God the fullest honor and worship. This is
called latria, the supreme worship allowed to God alone. After God the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we allow ourselves to <i>reverence</i> other created
beings. Thing of this as honor, such as is due a king or a ruler or some other
dignitary. Shuch honor is referred to as dulia, and this encapsulates reverence
that we show to St. Mary, the angels, and the saints. In fact, Catholics
recognize St. Mary as the pinnacle of the created order, and we give her not
latria, but an extreme form of dulia, called hyperdulia.

history of the Catholic Church. Here's a broad historical overview:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Early Church (1st–3rd centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Public Confession</b>: Serious sins (apostasy, murder, adultery) were
confessed <b><b>publicly</b></b> before the Christian community.</li>
<li><b>Once-in-a-lifetime Penance</b>: Penance was <b>long and harsh</b>, often lasting
months or years, and usually allowed <b>only once</b> after Baptism.</li>
<li><b>Reconciliation</b>: After completing the penance, the sinner was formally
reconciled by the bishop, often during Holy Week.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post-Constantinian Era (4th–6th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As Christianity gained legal status, <b><b>public penance</b></b> continued but
began to soften in practice.</li>
<li>The <b>bishop</b> played a key role in reconciliation.</li>
<li><b>Private spiritual direction</b> emerged, but public confession remained
standard for grave sins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Influence (6th–9th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Monastic practice in Ireland and Britain introduced <b>private
confession</b> to a priest or abbot.</li>
<li><b>Frequent confession*</b> became more common.</li>
<li>Penances were assigned using <b>penitential books</b> listing sins and
appropriate penances.</li>
<li>This model spread to continental Europe through missionaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medieval Period (9th–13th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>Fourth Lateran Council (1215)</b> mandated <b><b>annual confession</b></b> for all Catholics (the "Easter Duty").</li>
<li>Confession became <b><b>private, auricular</b></b>, and often <b><b>anonymous</b></b>.</li>
<li>The <b>seal of confession</b> (absolute secrecy) was firmly established.</li>
<li>Emphasis on the <b>three acts of the penitent</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Contrition</li>
<li>Confession</li>
<li>Satisfaction</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Council of Trent &amp; Counter-Reformation (1545–1563)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reaffirmed the necessity of <b>confession to a priest</b> for forgiveness of
mortal sins.</li>
<li>Stressed <b><b>sacramental grace</b></b> and the priest’s role in <b>absolution</b>.</li>
<li>Promoted regular, devout confession as part of Catholic life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern Period (19th–20th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Popes like <b>Pius X</b> encouraged <b>frequent confession</b> and <b>frequent Communion</b>.</li>
<li><b>Confessionals</b> became standard in churches for privacy.</li>
<li>Catechesis began to emphasize a <b>personal relationship with God</b> and
<b>interior conversion</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post-Vatican II Era (1960s–present)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Vatican II</b> highlighted the <b>communal and healing</b> aspects of the
sacrament.</li>
<li>Introduced <b>three forms</b> of the <b>Rite of Penance</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Individual confession and absolution (ordinary form).</li>
<li>Communal celebration with individual confession and absolution.</li>
<li>General absolution in emergencies (e.g., war, disaster).</li>
<li><b>Decline in regular practice</b> observed in many areas, though
<b>renewals</b> occur seasonally and in youth movements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<b>A Celibate Priesthood</b>
One argument against the validity of the is suggests that the Catholic Church
mandates celibacy for its priesthood, and this is contrary to the Scriptural
allowances for church leaders to be married and have children. We can borrow
text stating this argument:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1 Timothy 3:1-13 and Titus 1:6-9, the Apostle Paul seems to assume that
elders, bishops, overseers, and deacons will be married. Notice the phrases
“the husband of one wife” (1 Timothy 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6), “he must manage his
own family well” (1 Timothy 3:4,12), and “his children obey him with proper
respect” (1 Timothy 3:4; Titus 1:6). On a related issue, please read our
article on whether these Scripture mean that a church leader must be married
and have children. While these Scriptures are not a requirement for church
leaders to be married, they most definitely present an allowance for church
leaders to be married. It is therefore anti-biblical for any church to
require celibacy of its leaders. 
</p>

<p>
Why, then, does the Roman Catholic Church (and a few other Christian
denominations) require celibacy of priests/church leaders? (<i>source:
<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/celibacy-priests.html">gotquestions.org</a></i>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two fallacies in the above quote, which we may readily point out:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The Catholic Church actually allows does not require celibacy of all
priests. For example, priests within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches">Eastern Rite</a> may be married,
which is similar to Orthodox or Oriental churches outside of the Catholic
Church. Think of a rite as something similar to a Protestant
denomination. A rite upholds the authority of the Pope as well as Catholic 
dogmas, but it may vary in terms of disciplines, such as whether priests
may be married, or which form of the Mass is used. The Latin Rite (also
known as the Roman Rite) is the most well-known rite in America, and
indeed, Canon 277 in <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib2-cann208-329_en.html#CHAPTER_III.">Book II, Title III, Chapter III</a> of the Code of Canon
Law governing the Roman rite calls 
for celibacy among clerics: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the
sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is
a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to
Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more
freely to the service of God and humanity. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even within the Roman Rite, there are exceptions. The Pastoral Provision
of 1980 by Pope St. John Paul II allows for former non-Catholic priests
who convert to Catholicism to become priests, even if previously married
with children.
</p></li>

<li>There is no Scriptural prohibition preventing the Catholic Church from
exercising its authority requiring celibacy for its clerics in most
cases. Clerical celibacy mirors Christ's full dedication to the Church.</li>

<b>What Catholic Teachings and Practices Can Change Over Time?</b>
</p>
<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>

<p>
We find it helpful to borrow and insert an excerpt from David Currie's book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Fundamentalist-Again-Catholic/dp/089870569X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=N6DKLQ0CZQTV&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vDX3wDEgULuN8bgk8-pDtJaFRGshOT8g26SOSPOvjBmkArH1D-Zi_AyPp9cHH9EQ3rdoCrcPV7SljGS6TuNiVmGmHYm1EYaN29p4XFuCIXUtyyEa-etTcfCdPqFkQepI.mzbqSSA2JLUd9uzJquDieZCGhLfgkDJHtfTAryaPI8E&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=born+fundamentalist+born+again+catholic+by+david+currie&amp;qid=1746584011&amp;sprefix=David+Currie+Born%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-1">Born Evangelical, Born Again Catholic</a>. Here, Currie addresses the question of
<b>changing doctrines</b> in the Catholic church. Currie helpfully distinguishes
between types of doctrinal changes, and he categorizes Catholic teachings and
practices into five categores, which we abbreviate as <i>Deposit</i>, <i>Dogma</i>,
<i>Doctrine</i>, <i>Discipline</i>, and <i>Devotion</i>. I can do no better than to let Currie
speak for himself here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Change has occurred and will continue to occur. This was an important issue to
me because I felt that no organization could be the true church if it
contradicted itself on essential doctrines over time. I spent quite a bit of 
time thinking this over. Here are my observations.
</p>

<p>
Since change is a very general term, let us separate it into two parts. There is
a change that expands on prior truths without negating them, which I will call
“development”. This type of change “unpacks” meaning inherent in the original
truth so that the truth can be understood better. It defines. The other type of
change reverses that which has been accepted originally. I will call that type
“contradiction”. Contradiction affirms one day that “A” is true, and the next
insists that “non-A” is true.
</p>

<p>
There is one other distinction we must make. In thinking through this issue for
my own edification, I came to see that the information of the church could be
divided into at least five categories: deposit, dogma, doctrine, discipline, and
devotion. I devised these categories for my own thinking, so I suppose the
alliteration proves that I once studied homiletics. These are not the categories
of the church herself, but merely distinctions that helped me clarify the idea
of change.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deposit</b> is that body of truth originally given to the apostles. In time, some of
it was written into Scripture, while some of it remained in its original form of
oral tradition. Protecting this deposit is a major responsibility of the
bishops. The church teaches that nothing can be added to or contradicted within
the deposit. For example, Peter had no authority to make up a new story about
Jesus healing someone. General revelation ended with the death of John, the last
apostle. The goal regarding the deposit is simply to conserve it with no change
whatsoever. As an evangelical, I was surprised at how seriously Catholics
regarded this responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dogma</b> is that body of truth that has been affirmed by the councils of the
church and the Holy See of Rome. The further explanation, definition, and
development of the concepts within the deposit, as well as the deposit itself,
are contained within dogma. Once dogma is declared by the bishops, it can be
further developed but never contradicted by future doctrine or dogma. I could
find no case within Vatican II where earlier dogma was contradicted. Dogma is
usually declared in Council or by the Pope to combat a particular problem. For
example, the dogma regarding the divinity of Christ was not declared by counsel
until teachers in the early church questioned that truth of the deposit. The
deposit always contained the truths of Christ’s divinity, however. The Council
of Nicaea certainly did not invent new truth about Christ’s nature as
God-man. They merely clarified the truth already believed. So, dogma can be
developed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Doctrine</b> is the development of truth on the basis of the deposit and
dogma. Doctrine can develop and even contradict itself over time because it is
largely the thoughts of people. It has not been officially declared true or
false by the church. This is the realm in which most theologians deal, on the
cutting edge of the Church’s thinking. One Catholic theologian may totally
contradict another equally Catholic theologian. They both can’t be right, yet
the church is withholding her judgment on that particular issue. More thought,
more wisdom, or more time may be needed before the church decides which
formulation of that particular doctrine is fully consistent with the deposit and
dogma. Doctrine pushes the envelope of the Church as far and is only slowly if
ever, accepted as dogma.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise good, careful evangelical scholars make the mistake of taking doctrine
as the unchangeable teaching of the Church. When they see it changing over time,
they draw the wrong conclusions. The reason is relatively simple. The ultimate
authority in most evangelical churches of what is truly biblical rests with
those men teaching at the seminary from which that church draws its pastors. If
the pastor and board get into a theological tussle over some issue, it is not
unusual for a seminary professor to be called in to moderate and to decide the
truth in question. As a result, when these same evangelical scholars attempt to
understand what is really going on inside the Catholic Church, they make the
mistake of looking to their counterparts in the Catholic seminaries as the
authorities on Catholic theology. 
</p>

<p>
It seems that every evangelical pastor has at least one anti-Catholic book in
his study. When I informed my pastor of my intentions, he lent me a book written
by a professor at TEDS who is now at another institution. This truly fine
scholar stumbled rather dramatically in his research because he made precisely
the mistake of considering professors as the authorities. In the Catholic Church
the professor is not the final arbiter of truth; the bishops and the Pope
are. The church’s pronouncements are very accessible, but most evangelicals
don’t ever read these documents, much less footnote the, in their discussions of
what Catholics teach. You do not know what Catholics teach unless you go to the
sources that they themselves accept as authoritative. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Disciplines</b> are those rules that govern the everyday life of faithful
Catholics. This area has seen the most change (contradiction) in our generation,
and it is this very visible area that people usually point to when they accuse
the church of having changed since Vatican II. For example, in the past,
Catholics were required to fast on the Ember Days, 12 days each year. They are
no longer required to do this.
</p>

<p>
This is a bitter pill for evangelicals to swallow, but disciplines are supposed
to be mandatory once in force, yet some of them may be changed over time. It
would have been wrong for a Catholic to ignore the Ember Days fast in the
1950s. Yet now it is no longer necessary to fast on the former Ember Days
(except Good Friday) because this discipline has been rescinded. Why?  It has to
do with obedience.
</p>

<p>
As Christians, we are under the authority of the apostles’ successors, the
bishops. They are responsible for making rules that will enhance the spiritual
life of their flock. Although that goal never changes, the rules of discipline
may. When the bishops decide an existing rule is no longer effective in helping
people worship God, or when they determine that a new rule would be effective,
it is a Catholics duty to obey them. This is certainly in line with the promise:
“Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth will be loosed in heaven.” Disciplines by their very nature are going to
be developed and contradicted over time — bound when the need arises and loosed
when appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<b>Devotions</b> are the most personal of these five categories. Devotions are those 
activities by which an individual Christian may enhance his walk with God. The
Catholic use of “devotion” is much broader than the evangelical use of the
word. It means much more than Bible study and prayer. Devotions are never
mandatory for a Catholic layman, although they may be approved and are highly
recommended. History illustrates that devotions develop over time. One
well-known example of a devotion is the Rosary. I remember being relieved to
learn that a practicing Catholic could choose never to say the Rosary and still
be a good Catholic. A priest friend helped me understand that Christ and his
sacrificial death are at the very center of Catholic worship. The Rosary is only
about eight centuries old. Most Catholics, however, wonder why anyone would
choose not to speak with Mary. As a devotion, the Rosary is approved by the
church, but it is never mandated. Devotions can develop.

<p>
Some critics of the Catholic Church claim that it is an organization that looks
unlike the early church of the Bible. It is a behemoth of an organization with
a structure not described in the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
This criticism suffers from many flaws:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Underlying this claim is another claim: that all valid Christian practices
and beliefs must be explicitly found in the Bible. The great irony here is
that this claim does not pass its own test: it is found nowhere in the Bible
that a belief or practice must be found in the Bible.</li>

<b>Scriptural Origins of Ecclesial Structure</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>

<p>
The modern Catholic ecclesial structure—composed primarily of <b>bishops</b>,
<b>priests</b>, and <b>deacons</b> —-has both Scriptural roots and historical
development. The New Testament lays the foundation for this threefold
ministry, which the Catholic Church understands as being instituted by Christ
and developed under the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the early Church. 
</p>

<p>
Below is a breakdown of Scriptural support for each of these offices:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Bishops</b> (Greek: ἐπίσκοπος – episkopos, "overseer")
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scriptural references
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acts 1:20 – Peter interprets Psalm 109:8 to establish a replacement for
Judas: “His office let another take.” The Greek word used is episkopē.</li>
<li><p>
Acts 20:28 – Paul tells the elders of Ephesus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the Holy
Spirit has made you overseers (episkopoi), to shepherd the church of
God.” 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
1 Timothy 3:1–7 – Paul describes the qualities of a bishop/overseer
(episkopos):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><b>Early Church understanding</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The terms presbyter (elder) and episkopos (overseer) were used somewhat
interchangeably early on, but by the 2nd century (cf. St. Ignatius of
Antioch, still very early in the second century), a clearer distinction
was made between bishops and presbyters (priests).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Priests</b> (Greek: πρεσβύτερος – <i>presbyteros</i>, "elder")
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scriptural References:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Acts 14:23 – Paul and Barnabas appoint elders (presbyteroi) in each
church:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“And when they had appointed elders for them in every church&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
1 Timothy 5:17 –
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,
especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
James 5:14 –
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord.”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note: The term <i>presbyteros</i> evolved into the English word “priest”,
particularly as it passed through Latin (presbyter). In Catholic
theology, presbyters share in the bishop’s priesthood and are primarily
responsible for the sacraments and preaching in local communities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Deacons</b> (Greek: διάκονος – diakonos, "servant" or "minister")
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scriptural References:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acts 6:1–6 – Seven men (including Stephen and Philip) are appointed to
serve tables so the apostles can focus on prayer and the Word. While
not called "deacons" here, this is traditionally seen as the origin of
the diaconate.</li>
<li><p>
Philippians 1:1 – Paul addresses:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the
bishops (episkopoi) and deacons (diakonoi).” 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>1 Timothy 3:8–13 – Paul gives qualifications for deacons, showing it as
a distinct and recognized office.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Historical Continuity</b>
</p>

<p>
The Catholic Church sees this structure as apostolic in origin, with apostolic 
succession preserving the offices—especially the episcopate—from the time of
the apostles to today. The bishops are considered the successors to the
apostles; priests are their collaborators, and deacons continue the
service-oriented ministry first seen in Acts 6.

Catholics are pro-life because God is pro-life. Divine revelation tells us that

each person has infinite dignity. Furthermore, we believe that the shedding of
innocent blood is <i>always</i> wrong. There is no more innocent person than a baby,
especially a baby in the womb who has not done any wrong. Therefore, babies in
the womb are the most innocent among us, and they are the most vulnerable. To

If you feel God's prompting to explore Catholicism, or if you simply want to
learn more, you have several options.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Adults may enroll in the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults
(OCIA). Typically free of charge, this entails several months of classroom
instruction and, if you wish, it will culminate in the three sacraments of
Christian initiation: baptism, confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist. This is
focused on orienting an individual toward a lifelong journey of discipleship
and service to Christ.
</p>

<p>
Typically, OCIA courses commence in the fall (around August or September) and
conclude with batpisms, confirmations, and first communion around Easter.
</p>

<p>
Local to the Waco area are offerings by several Catholic parishes or centers:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://baylorcatholic.org">St. Peter's Catholic Student Center</a> at the edge of Baylor's campus caters
heavily to Baylor's students. Faculty, staff, and friends of the
university also participate at St. Peter's. The OCIA courses at
St. Peter's are called the <a href="https://baylorcatholic.org/catholicism-1">Basic Teachings</a>, and typically take place on Monday
nights.</li>
<li><a href="https://stlouiswaco.com">St. Louis Catholic Church</a> is a family-friendly parish that also runs the
only Catholic school in Waco. St. Louis is a thriving parish, with over
1000 families represented. In 2024, St. Louis grew from about 1300
families to over 1900 families. You may <a href="https://stlouiswaco.com/rcia">sign up</a> for the St. Louis OCIA
program.</li>
<li><a href="https://stjosephwaco.com">St. Joseph Catholic Church</a> is located close to the Baylor Campus. Less
student-centric and more family-oriented, St. Jospeh also offers <a href="https://stjosephwaco.com/ocia">OCIA</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are also several other parishes in the Waco area that offer OCIA.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If you are so excited and so moved that you don't want to wait for OCIA
(you'll eventually have to take it, unless you are exceptionally prepared; an
interview with a priest may reveal that you are ready to be initiated right
away).

You can begin learning on your own. Fr. John Riccardo is a great catechist
and evangelist, and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2oBIjKcCFUI03M67Wk14mfqN4fTFVfkE">YouTube playlist</a> has a full set of OCIA courses for

<a href="https://www.ewtn.com/radio/shows/called-to-communion">Called to Communion</a> is an hour-long live call-in radio show with a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9CQlldupc5-V0O8pdxElKJMjJmC7Hfdc&amp;si=UHBUulMLByPVEyVs">YouTube
livestream</a>. Here, Dr. David Anders, a Presbyterian-turned-Catholic, answers
hard-hitting questions, especially those from Protestants. The show airs at 1:00
PM Central Time on weekdays. The show tagline is, "What is stopping you from
becoming Catholic?" Dr. Anders was a student and friend to the late
Dr. R.C. Sproul. Dr. Anders has a very broad and very deep knowledge of the
Protestant Reformation and the early Church Fathers.

Here's another fun excerpt of a show. Here, Giovanni, a transgender individual
gives a testimonial about how is faith was bolstered by a talk with Dr. Anders.
