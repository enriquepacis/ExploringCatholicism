</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>This is <i>The Calling of St. Matthew</i> by Caravaggio (1599-1600 AD). Caravaggio depicts Levi, the tax collector, going about his business in the activity of his trade, which brought him great wealth through through extortion. Yet, Jesus generously invited Levi to follow Him. Caravaggio paints the moment when Levi recognizes that Our Lord's invitation first as personal and secondly as his own. Levi then had to choose between his fortune or a mysterious and unknown future with this itinerant rabi, Jesus. Would Levi follow his own vision, or that of Jesus? Would he puruse his own will, or God's? What did Levi choose? If he had chosen his own will, purposes, and glory, would we remember St. Matthew to this day? Indeed the painting is anachronistic: the clothing styles from around the 17th century depict a scene from the first century; however, this anachronism liberates the truth depicted here from reaching beyond the first century into the present day. Like Levi, Christ invites all of us at every moment to a deeper walk with Him, a greater surrender to His will, to a deeper conversion, a growing holiness, and into the glorious mystery of who He is. To what are you being called, and what will you choose? Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>
I am a former Evangelical Christian turned Catholic. I'm not sure
there's any formal definition for this term, but I might like to
take the label <b>Evangelical Catholic</b> for myself. Why? Because becoming Catholic
has given me new ways to build a loving relationship with Jesus, in addition to
all the same ways I could do so as an Evangelical Protestant. Thus, I love to
talk about joyful faith in Jesus Christ, and how Catholicism unlocks <span class="underline">all</span> of
it. After all, should only Protestants get to be Evangelical?
</p>

<p>
How can someone go from a loving, personal relationship with Christ as an
Evangelical Christian to a loving relationship with Christ as a Catholic? Many
Protestants will say that is not possible, because the Catholic Church does not
teach the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. Nonetheless, this has been the journey of
not just myself, but many other Catholic converts from various forms of
Protestantism or Anglicanism, not to mention other faiths, as well. This site is
about the matters of faith and reason that led me to Catholicism.
</p>

<p>
I never would have been open to exploring Catholicism if I had found no lack in
Protestant teachings. Indeed, questions arose for which I found no good answer
in and among my Protestant friends or within the Protestant world. The two most
significant questions for me were as follows:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>If the Catholic Church gave us the Bible, why shouldn't the Catholic Church
be able to authoritatively interpret the Bible?</b> As I learned more about how
the Bible came about, I saw how early Church councils defined the contents of
the Bible. It seemed to me that to draw the boundaries on the contents of the
Bible is a greater power than the ability to interpret the Bible, for if the
Church finds some writing objectionable, that very Church that compiled the
Scriptures now called the Bible should have defined that objectionable text
out of the Bible.</li>
<li><b>Was the Eucharist truly the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ?</b> Jesus taught
this in John 6. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John martyred within 20
year of St. John's own death, also seemed to think so. So did the
preponderance of Christian writers through the centuries. While my own
Evangelical denomination teaches that elements of communion are merely
symbolic, and many of my former fellow Christian believers recoiled at the
thought of Christ being truly present in the bread and grape juice, I was
startled to learn that even Martin Luther himself thought that Christ was
truly present in the Eucharist; and John Calvin  taught that Holy Communion
was much more than a symbol. The symbolist view  was historically considered
heretical by Christians, until it swept through the Protestant movement in 
the 1520s. At this time, Ulrich Zwingli promoted a  symbolist view in
opposition to Martin Luther, who advocated for the Real Presence. Did the first 15 centuries of Christians get it wrong?</li>
</ol>

<p>
As I explored these questions and found considerable evidence to think that the
Catholic Church has the correct position here, I became unsettled in the worldview
which had been taught to me in my Protestant upbringing. I was forced to learn
more.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why be Catholic?</b>
</p>
<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
It is also worthwhile to briefly list some the things that drew me toward
Catholicism. In Catholicism, I can love God in all the same ways I could as a
Protestant (prayer, the reading and teaching of the Holy Scriptures, obedience
to God), and I have new avenues and resources for growth. Some new tools
include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Sacraments. I&#x2013;like many Protestants&#x2013;used to ask, "Why do I need the
Sacraments?" I have direct access to God. I'm fine with just me, God, and the
Bible. I've since come to look at the Sacraments as powerful tools that bring
me into full and intimate contact with God. They are a gift He wants us to
have. Why wouldn't I we want a gift that God wants me to have? As for me, <b>I
want to accept everything the Lord offers me.</b></li>
<li>New ways to pray.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the Mass is the highest form of prayer for Catholics. It is both public
and very personal at the same time. It includes an intimate physical and
spiritual encounter with Jesus, whether I feel it or not. I can go to Mass
just about every day of the week to encounter Jesus. In the Mass, and
especially at the reception of the Eucharist, <b>Christ Gives Himself
fully to me, and at the same moment, I offer myself&#x2013;as
fully as I know how&#x2013;to Him</b>.</li>
<li><p>
Mental prayer.
</p>

<p>
Mental prayer is a gift that some non-Catholics also enjoy; however,
within Catholicism, mental prayer&#x2013;though not entirely up to the
individual, but also dependent on sovereign action by God Himself&#x2013;is a
beautiful, intimate, and powerful form of prayer. Because of this
dependence on God, we cannot always perform mental prayer at will;
however, we can by our will prepare ourselves for whatever mental divine
contact God wills to give us. It will require quieting the impulses of the
flesh and tuning out the voices of the world and the flesh. Thus, it
requires effort and openness to God and His ``still, small voice.'' This
is internal and comtemplative. The objective here is for the soul to be
ready for God to speak into our lives.

<li>Well-developed methods for growing into the image of Christ
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Spiritual Exercises by St. Ignatius
Spend some time separated from the world in a place of tranquility to
meditate on the life of Christ and prayerfully consider what God may be
calling you toward, and discern immediate next steps. Learn how to use
for the glory of God every aspect of your life and the circumstances God
has allowed to surround you. The Spiritual exercises were developed by
St. Ignatius of Antioch, regarded as a spiritual master of discernment.</li>
<li>The practice of spiritual direction</li>
<li>Mental Prayer</li>
<li>Daily prayers and devotions bring Christ into our daily lives
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Rosary</li>
<li>The Angelus.
Turn your heart toward God at several times during the day. Reflect on
St. Mary and her example of submitting to God's will, and the
fruitfulness that submission to God causes in our lives.</li>
<li>The Morning Offering</li>
<li>The <i>Suscipe</i></li>
<li>The Divine Office</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Liturgical Calendar, in which every day is holy and has
significance.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Communion with the angels and the saints. The angels and the saints can pray
for us!
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In a fallen world where celebrities and heroes lead twisted and
immoral lives, the saints lived lives of heroic virtue and provide examples
for us on how to love Christ above all the temporal goods this world can
offer. Not that love for worldy goods is bad; rather love for worldly goods
that is <i>disordered</i> is bad. There is a specific order: God above all
goods, for He is our ultimate good; and then, depending on one's state in
life, other loves should have their proper order: spouse, children, work,
etc. The saints model for us how to put God first, and we can seek their
help in doing just that.</li>
<li>God&#x2013;in His generous love for us&#x2013;loves each person so much that He has
appointed at least one guardian  angel specifically to accompany each
individual. Most of us ingore this powerful being, but, in fact, we can
ask our guardian angel for intercession and help accoring to God's will.

In the end, there is <b>only one reason to become Catholic</b>: <i>because the teachings
of the Catholic Church are true</i>. If the teachings of the Catholic Church are
<span class="underline">not</span> true, then Catholicism is not worth our time. However, I believe that its
teachings hold up under scrutiny, indeed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Knowing Christ and walking with Him is a journey of joy.</b> I converted to
Catholicism because after much study and learning, I believe the teachings of
the Catholic Church contain the fullness of truth about God. To know Christ, Who
is the Way, the Truth and the Life, we must discern what is true and hold fast
to it. I invite you to walk with me down this path.

<div id="outline-container-truth" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-truth">
<p>
It is helpful to begin with the concept of <b>truth</b>, because if there is no truth, then
there is no point in discussion. We show first that <b>there must be truth</b>;
and second, that <b>truth is absolute</b>. Along the way, we pick up an important
tool, <b>the principle of non-contradiction</b>, which we can use to demonstrate that
some ideas (or propositions) are invalid and must be rejected.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-there-must-be-truth" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="there-must-be-truth">There <span class="underline">must</span> be Truth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-there-must-be-truth">
<p>
An important starting point is truth. Truth must exist, and it must be
absolute. If not, then why do we even spend time talking, discussing, and
debating? Why not allow everyone to go off on their own and manifest his or her
own reality as he or she sees fit? Clearly this is absurd.
</p>

<p>
We can more rigorously conclude that <i>there must be truth</i> if we start with the
another antithetical proposition, which we call <b>proposition A</b>:
</p>
<div class="note" id="orgcd8421d">
<p>
<b>Proposition A</b> <br />
There is no truth.
</p>

</div>
<p>
The problem with proposition <b>A</b> arises when we ask, "Is <b>A</b> true?" If the
response is <b>yes</b>, then a truth exists, and <b>A</b> becomes false. This is a
contradiction, and it cannot possibly be valid according to the rules of logic,
namely the principle of non-contradiction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org074f8f4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org074f8f4">The Principle of Non-contradiction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org074f8f4">
<p>
The principle of non-contradiction is a law of logic:
</p>
<div class="note" id="org8911578">
<p>
<b>The Principle of Non-Contradiction</b> <br />
A proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time in the same respect.
</p>

</div>

<p>
This is foundational to logical reasoning and coherent thought.
</p>

<p>
The principle&#x2013;sometimes called a <b>law</b>&#x2013;of non-contradiction tells us that
<i>there is no truth</i> is invalid, and it must be rejected. If we reject <i>there is
no truth</i>, then we are left with the principle that <b>there <span class="underline">must</span> be truth</b>.
</p>

<p>
This is comforting when we remember Jesus Christ claimed to be the Way, the Truth, and
the Light. The truth is something foundational and concrete.

</p>

</div>
<p>
We can explore the validity of <b>B</b> in much the same way as we did for <b>A</b>. We can ask if <b>B</b> is 
<i>absolutely</i> true. If the answer is yes (it is absolutely true)&#x2013;as so many who
would invoke proposition <b>B</b> would like us to believe&#x2013;, then <b>B</b> has negated
itself, again becoming absurd and invalid. Now, not only can we conclude that
<b>there must be truth</b>, but also that <b>truth is absolute</b>.

<h3 id="faith-and-reason">Faith and Reason</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-faith-and-reason">
<p>
Now that we know that <b>truth exists</b>, and reason can help us access truth, we
might want to consider the relationship between faith and reason. By reason, we
can uncover truth through deduction; and the scientific method&#x2013;built on
induction&#x2013;is an extension of reason by which we can uncover truths about the
created universe. Also, we have noted that by reason, we can uncover truth about
the cause of the universe because of what we know about the universe through
observation.
</p>

<p>
But, what about faith? Faith is reception of or tust in the testimony of others
about things we are not able to observe directly nor reason about directly. We
use faith in the practical world on a regular basis. For example, we ask someone
where to find a place or a thing; they tell us, and we follow their
instructions. In the realm of faith in God, we receive revelation from God
through the Church or the Scriptures. This is often information we cannot obtain
through reason alone. For example, we could reason that God exists, but we could
not obtain without revelation that God is one being in the Persons of Father and
Son and Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
Here is a clarifying video about how faith and reason work together.

<p>
In addition to having shown that there must be truth and truth must be absolute,
we also have acquired the principle of non-contradiction. This is very
important, because it allows us to identify and reject ideas which are invalid
based on contradictions within the ideas themselves. I believe this is also a
tool for theology: something cannot be both true and false at the same time in
the realm of faith. Such a theological proposition would contradict itself, and
it would be invalid.

<h3 id="truth-applied">Applications of Truth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-truth-applied">
<p>
Now that we know that truth exists and it is absolute, we are in a position to
apply it. We can do so in a few ways. I will use it to argue the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The universe tells us that there is a God. It doesn't necessarily tell us
directly that God is like the God of Christians, but it leads us to something
that fits the kind of being in which Christians believe to be God, along with
the faithful of other religions. To know more about this being, we would need
to spend more time discussing the revelation given to us by reason and
nature, or we need to add divine revelation.
</p>

<div class="note" id="org36d3192">
<a id="what-is-god"><b>What is God?</b></a>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>


<p>
To learn what God is like, we can look to the universe. We can argue the
following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Anything that has a beginning has a cause.</li>
<li>The universe has a beginning.
There are two ways to support this:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Using evidence from science.</li>
<li>Using reason alone.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If the universe has no beginning, it would have endured for an infinite
amount of time to arrive at the present.</li>
<li>It is impossible to traverse an infinite period of time to arrive at the</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Thus, the universe has a cause.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It turns out that the universe has plenty to tell us about its cause. The
universe contains all matter, energy, space, and time&#x2013;or else it wouldn't be 
the universe. Since the universe contains all matter, energy, space and time,
its cause must be independent of each of these. In other words, the cause of
the universe must be immaterial (independent of matter, energy, and space) as
well as eternal (independent or outside of time). At this point, the cause of
the universe begins to match the characteristic of the entity Christians and
adherents of other faiths call <i>God</i>. And since this cause of the universe is
outside of space and time, we can say that it is unchanging, for without time,
there is no change.
</p>

<p>
What we have learned about the cause of the universe appears to be lacking some
features of what Christians call God. In particular, the universe does not
immediately indicate that its cause has a personality. That is, we have not yet
established that the cause of the universe is a <i>personal</i> entity.
</p>

<p>
Now, we may ask, what could cause the unchanging cause of the universe to create
the universe? If the cause of the universe is unchanging, then nothing could
make it create a universe. However, such an all-powerful entity <i>chose</i>
to create out of its own free will. To posess a will and the faculty of choice
could explain the creation of the universe. For the cause of the universe to
have free will and choice implies personhood or personality within this
immaterial and eternal cause.

<summary>Read more (Really? Are you even Christian?!?) ...</summary>

<p>
I declare it's true: God does not exist.
</p>

<p>
To understand this, we must understand what <i>exist</i> means. The word "exist"
comes from Latin: <i>ex</i> means "from, out, outside of," and "ist" comes from <i>sistere</i>,
which means "to set up, to cause to stand." Thus, for something to <i>exist</i>
conveys the sense that it arises from something else.
</p>

<p>
While the universe is contingent upon its cause&#x2013;and as Christians, we believe
that cause to be God&#x2013;God is not existent in the sense that His being arises
from something else. Thus, I claim that <b>God does not exist</b>.
</p>

<p>
Rather, the fullness of teaching about God is that <b>God is being itself</b>. This
concept says that God is the fundamental source and essence of
existence. Anything that exists does so by sharing in God's being. If God ceased
to be, then everything that exists ceases to exist, also.
</p>

<p>
This concept of God as being itself aligns with God's self-identification as "I
AM" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A14&amp;version=RSVCE">Exodus 3:14</a>; and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A58-59&amp;version=RSVCE">John 8:58-59</a>). He is not from someone or something else;
God simply <i>is</i>.

You are loved. With the help of some divine revelation and human philosophy,
follows from the discussion above about God's nature and God's will.

<div class="note" id="org206a470">
<a id="you-are-loved"><b>YOU are LOVED</b></a>

<details>
<summary>Read about how your existence means God loves you ...</summary>

<p>
In the Catholic faith, we believe something profound and beautiful: your very
existence is no accident. The fact that you are alive—right here, right
now—is a sign that God not only created you, but continues to will your
existence at every moment. As St. Thomas Aquinas taught, creation isn’t just
something God did once, long ago. Rather, He holds you in being with every
breath you take. You exist because God loves you into existence. 
</p>

<p>
This is not merely poetic—it is the truth. God is Being itself (“I AM who
AM,” Exodus 3:14), and everything that exists shares in His being. But unlike
inanimate things, you are made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis
1:27). You are a person—capable of knowing, loving, and choosing Him in
return. That is not something arbitrary. It’s a calling, woven into your very
being. 
</p>

<p>
And so even in the hardest moments—when life feels heavy, when suffering is
close, when God may even seem distant—the truth remains: if you are alive,
God is sustaining you. He has not withdrawn His love. In fact, it is often
precisely in suffering that He opens the door for you to draw closest to Him.
</p>

<p>
As the Catechism reminds us (<a href="https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/14/">CCC 27</a>), “the desire for God is written in the
human heart,” and “God never ceases to draw man to himself.” Suffering
doesn’t cancel that call—it can deepen it. When we freely choose to trust Him
in our pain, when we choose to remain open to His presence rather than
closing in on despair, we are brought nearer to the Cross—and through it, to
the Resurrection. 
</p>

<p>
Jesus Himself did not avoid suffering. He entered it fully, out of love for
us. And now, in our own trials, we have the opportunity to unite ourselves to
Him—to know Him not only as Creator and Sustainer, but as the Crucified One
who is with us, and the Risen One who gives meaning to our pain. St. Paul
recognized that suffering has a way of uniting us to Christ and revealing His
love for us (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203%3A7-10&amp;version=NRSVCE">Ephesians 3:7-11, NRSVCE</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
7 Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of
Christ. 8 More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the
surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have
suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that
I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own
that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the
righteousness from God based on faith. 10 I want to <b>know Christ</b> and the
<b>power of his resurrection</b> and <b>the sharing of his sufferings</b> by becoming like
him in his death, 11 if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, the fact that you are alive today means this: God is still offering you
His love, His grace, His very life. He is giving you the chance—moment by
moment—to choose Him, to seek Him, and to know Him more deeply. Even when the
path is dark, He walks it with you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>You are here because God, in His Love, <i>actively</i> wills you to be here</b>. And
God is not finished with you yet.

I was quite happy to be an Evangelical Christian, and I certainly believed that

expository teaching with beautiful application of both Old Testament and New
Testament scriptures. In my military time and during engineering graduate
school, I also tried an Evangelical Presbyterian church, a few non-denominationa
churches, a Southern Baptist Church, a Missionary Church, and an Evangelical
Free church.
</p>

<p>
At a Presbyterian church, I remember sitting in a Sunday school class, in which
a young woman asked the pastor, "Pastor, I have a question I don't know how to
handle. It came from a Catholic friend, who asked, 'If the Catholic Church gave
us the Bible, why shouldn't the Catholic Church be able to interpret the
Bible?'"
</p>

<p>
I do not recall the pastor's example. It was not nearly as memorable or as
cogent as the young woman's question. I let the question go, and I didn't think
about it for about 4-5 years.
</p>

<p>
As time went on, I thought about this on occasion. I remember concluding to
myself that the ability to define Scriptures is greater than the ability to
interpret it. For example, if you don't like an undeniable interpretation of a
certain passage, why cannonize it as Scripture in the first place?
</p>

<p>
Later, I learned that the process by which the Bible developed. It is not as
clear-cut as many would like it to be. This process highlights the need for an
additional authority aside from the Bible to even have a Bible. Since the Bible
doesn't define itself, to recognize a certain set of scriptures as <i>the Bible</i>
requrires an additional authority. Additionally, from Christian antiquity to the
modern age, different Christian traditions follow different set of books as
their sacred scriptures: there is no uniform agreement about what is the
Bible. Any Christian who says "I have the true, infallible Bible in my hand, and
the others are incorrect," must explain how they know this is the correct Bible,
and how they are infallibly sure. They will no doubt fall back on some authority
that says this is the correct Bible, not that one. Furthermore, if that
authority has infallibly identified the correct Bible, then we have an
infallible authority <i>apart from</i> the Bible. Thus, the Bible cannot be the only
infallible authority for Christians.

<b>Is there an Objectively Correct Way to Interpret Scripture?</b>
</p>

<details>

<p>
Under <i>sola scriptura</i>, when two individuals disagree on the interpretation of
Scripture, there is no objective way to determine whose interpretation is
correct. This is highlighted by the following exchange/discussion:

<p>
Cliff Knechtle did not leave the questioner or the audience an objective way to
determine who is right and who is wrong. It is up to each individual's
interpretation, and each party to the dispute had better hope that he has
listened correctly to the Holy Spirit. Additionally, by the principle of
non-contradiction, we can know that in a dispute when proposed views are
contradictory or mutally exclusive, both sides cannot be correct.
</p>

<p>
This is a major weakness in <i>sola scriptura</i> that can be addressed if not just
Scripture alone, but also the other authorities&#x2013;the magisterial (teaching)
authority of the Church and Her Tradition&#x2013;can be brought in to adjudicate.
</p>

<p>
When we are no longer bound by <i>sola scriptura</i>, we have other authorities and
other tools, which also include natural law, to guide us into all truth in an
objective manner.

<b>What are Tradition a the Magisterium?</b>

<p>
The Bible came from somewhere. It actually came from Tradition, and we might
think of it as part of Tradition that got written down. The Catholic Church
recognizes Tradition and Magisterial Authority as other infallible authorities
in the life of a Christian, in addition to the Scriptures. But, what are
Tradition and Magisterium?

<p>
The doctrine of <i>sola scriptura</i> is often understood as the belief that the
Bible is the only infallible authority for Christian faith and
practice. However, this position faces a significant challenge: in order to know
what constitutes the Bible, an external authority is required to delineate the
contents of Scripture. The Bible itself does not provide its own table of
contents. This means that, before one can appeal to the Bible as the sole
infallible authority, one must first rely on an authority to define what "the
Bible" actually is.

<h4 id="org582dd7a">The Role of Authority in Defining Scripture: A Challenge to Sola Scriptura</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org582dd7a">
<p>
The doctrine of <i>sola scriptura</i> is often understood as the belief that the
Bible is the only infallible authority for Christian faith and
practice. However, this position is problematic because it presumes that the
Bible is self-defining—yet, the Bible does not contain its own <b>table of
contents</b>. Instead, the contents of Scripture were determined by an external
authority. The historical development of the Christian canon demonstrates that
the Church played a necessary and authoritative role in recognizing and defining
Scripture.
</p>

<p>
If we require another infallible authority to know what Scriptures are included
in the Bible, then the Bible cannot be the sole infallible authority for
Christian life and worship.

<li><a id="org5f9eca2"></a>The Development of the Christian Scriptures<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5f9eca2">
<p>
The Bible as we know it today did not appear as a single, bound volume in the
early Church. Instead, the books of both the <b><b>Old Testament</b></b> and <b><b>New
Testament</b></b> were compiled over time, with different traditions preserving
different sets of books. The process of recognizing and defining Scripture was a
<b><b>complex, authoritative decision</b></b> rather than an automatic or universally
agreed-upon process. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b><b>Old Testament</b></b> consists of writings compiled over centuries, with
different groups accepting different books.</li>
<li>The <b><b>New Testament</b></b> was written in the first century, but disputes over
which books were authoritative continued for centuries.</li>
<li>Church councils (such as <b><b>Rome AD 382, Hippo AD 393, Carthage AD 397</b></b>)
played a key role in affirming the New Testament canon.</li>
<li>The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century led to a rejection of certain
Old Testament books previously accepted by Christians.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The very fact that <b><b>Christians today accept different canons</b></b> highlights the need for an external authority to determine which books belong in Scripture.

<p>
Many Protestant arguments claim that the Church merely "recognized" which books
were inspired, rather than defining them. However, this <b><b>does not solve the
problem of authority</b></b>: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The act of <b>recognition</b> itself requires <b><b>a group or council</b></b> to make
authoritative judgments.</li>
<li>Recognition relies on <b>criteria</b> such as <b><b>apostolic authorship</b></b>, yet these
criteria were **set by an authority**—not by Scripture itself.</li>
<li>The <b><b>different canons in use today</b></b> prove that the identification of inspired Scripture was not self-evident, but required a <b><b>teaching authority</b></b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a believer chooses a particular <b><b>canon of Scripture</b></b>, they are necessarily
submitting to <b><b>the authority that defined that canon</b></b>. If they claim their
canon is <b><b>infallibly correct</b></b>, then they implicitly grant <b><b>infallibility</b></b> to
the authority that established that canon. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org0634b9b"></a>Conclusion: The Limits of Sola Scriptura<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org0634b9b">
<p>
Given the historical development of the canon, the role of Church councils, and
the differences between Christian Bibles today, <b>sola scriptura</b> as an absolute
doctrine is untenable. The Bible is not a self-authenticating authority; its
very contents were **established by an external authority**—the Church. 
</p>

<p>
This means that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <b><b>canon of Scripture itself</b></b> is an extra-biblical tradition.</li>
<li>The process of <b><b>recognizing</b></b> Scripture requires an authority outside of
Scripture.</li>
<li>The differences in <b><b>Christian canons</b></b> today prove that an <b><b>authoritative
Church</b></b> is necessary to define Scripture.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thus, the claim that "the Bible alone is the only infallible authority" is
self-defeating. Without an infallible Church to define what belongs in the
Bible, one cannot even know <b><b>which Bible</b></b> to follow. The <b><b>authority of the
Church</b></b> is inescapable in the formation, recognition, and interpretation of
Scripture.

<h4 id="org9710fbe">The Problem for Sola Scriptura</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9710fbe">
<p>
Given these historical realities, <code>sola scriptura</code> faces a serious problem: if
the Bible is the only infallible authority, how does one determine what
constitutes "the Bible" without appealing to an external authority? 
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org3d6a10e"></a>1. The Necessity of an External Authority<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3d6a10e">
<p>
Without the Church's authority, one would have no objective way to know which books belong in the canon.
</p>

<p>
The early Church played a central role in collecting, preserving, and recognizing inspired writings.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org5a4d5cd"></a>2. The "Recognition" Argument Does Not Solve the Issue<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5a4d5cd">
<p>
Some argue that the Church does not define Scripture but merely recognizes inspired writings.
</p>

<p>
However, recognition itself is an act of authority: it either relies on a group (e.g., bishops, Jewish scholars) or on a test (e.g., apostolic authorship).
</p>

<p>
If a test is used, then we depend on the authority of those who established that test.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org23a0f5c"></a>3. The Existence of Differing Canons Highlights the Problem<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org23a0f5c">
<p>
If the Bible were self-evident in its contents, there would be no dispute over which books belong.
</p>

<p>
Yet, various Christian traditions hold different canons, meaning believers submit to an external authority in choosing the "correct" canon.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgbfebc0d"></a>4. The Infallibility Problem<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgbfebc0d">
<p>
If a believer holds that their canon is infallibly correct, then the authority that defined that canon must also be infallible.
</p>

<p>
This contradicts the claim that the Bible alone is the only infallible authority.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of <code>sola scriptura</code>, understood as the Bible being the sole infallible authority, is self-refuting. The very act of defining the Bible's contents requires an external authority. Since different Christian traditions accept different canons, the believer must ultimately submit to an authority beyond Scripture to determine what counts as Scripture in the first place. Thus, the role of the Church in establishing and identifying the Scriptures is indispensable, demonstrating that an authoritative, living tradition is necessary alongside the written Word of God.

<h3 id="org4279932">Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4279932">
<p>
A dogma central to Luther's Protestant reformation is summarized by the phrase
<i>sola fide</i>, which is translated "by faith alone." This encapsulates the idea
that man is saved or <i>justified</i> in God's sight by faith alone.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is important to ask the question: can man be saved by faith alone?
</p>

<p>
If you wish, you may view a video I made on this very topic:
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBypIA26vTs?si=BejzbpaN9AkIwvbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
My conditioning to believe in <i>sola fide</i> was one of the major obstacles for me
to embracing Catholicism, even though I was already persuaded that <i>sola
scriptura</i> was not defensible, and I favored the Orthodox teaching of the Real
Presence of Christ in the Eucharist over the symbolist interpretation of some
Protestant groups.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Akin provides one of the clearest and most comprehensive discussions on
<i>sola fide</i> that I've seen. A great challenge here is that the Bible uses
<i>faith</i> in a few different ways, and it leads us as Christians to understand
faith differently. Jimmy helps us navigate this and find a common understanding
of the various ways <i>faith</i> is used in the Scriptures. In the end, I think it's
helpful to use this more common language so that we can actually compare and
contrast Catholic and Protestant views on the role of faith in salvation. It's
worthwhile, indeed.

<h3 id="org0893cd9">Evidence For <i>Sola Fide</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0893cd9">
<p>
Many proponents of <i>sola fide</i> say that the Bible plainly states that man is
saved by faith alone in Ephesians 2:8-10:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing;
it is the gift of God— not the result of works, so that no one may boast
(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-10&amp;version=NRSVCE">Ephesians 2:8-10, NRSVCE</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This verse <i>excludes</i> works as a means of salvation, leaving only grace and
faith as causes of salvation. Thus, a <i>sola-fide</i> adherent will reason, no works
done by a human can earn their salvation, and only faith can save.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, additional verses support the exclusion of works as a means of
salvation:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A20&amp;version=NRSVCE">Romans 3:20 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For “no human being will be justified in his sight” by
deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A27&amp;version=NRSVCE">Romans 3:27 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? By that of works?
No, but by the law of faith.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16&amp;version=NRSVCE">Galatians 2:16 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but
through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ
Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing
the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the
law.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A5&amp;version=NRSVCE">Galatians 3:5 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by
your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A10%2D13&amp;version=NRSVCE">Galatians 3:11-13 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is
written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
written in the book of the law.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
before God by the law; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[a]
12 But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the
works of the law will live by them.” 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>
Because of verses such as these, proponents of <i>sola fide</i> support the dogma
that man is justified not by works, but rather by faith alone. Works are
insufficient in this view to <i>justify</i> humans&#x2013;that is, to qualify us for
salvation and an afterlife in the loving presence of God.

<b>Eternal Security or the Perseverance of the Saints</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
<i>Sola Fide</i> also leads to another dogma called <b>eternal security</b> or <b>the
perseverance of the saints</b>. Eternal security follows from <i>sola fide</i>, for since
one's works cannot contrubte to salvation, they cannot imperil one's
salvation. However, even in the Protestant world, there is poor agreement about
the perseverance of the saints: Calvinists and Baptitsts tend toward the
perseverance of the saints, but numerous Evangelical denominations follow the
Arminian tradition, which teaches that a Christian may lose his or her
salvation. From this, we can deduce that there is no Scripture that 
irrevocably establishes eternal security, or the debate would be laid to rest. 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, several passages of Scripture suggest that one can fall
away from salvation. At the very least, these Scriptures should indicate that
eternal security is not such a secure doctrine. Notable Scripture passages
include: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">

<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A1-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 13:1-23 (RSVCE)</a>: Here, Jesus gives the Parable of the Sower:
</p>

<details>

<summary>Read more...</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>
3 Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to
sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and
the birds came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not
have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But
when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because
they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked
the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a
hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them
hear.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This left his audience, including his disciples puzzled. Later, He explained
it to His disciples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
18 “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 19 When anyone hears
the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes
and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along
the path. 20 The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the
word and at once receives it with joy. 21 But since they have no root, they
last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the
word, they quickly fall away. 22 The seed falling among the thorns refers to
someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the
deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. 23 But the seed
falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands
it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty
times what was sown.” 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For clarity, we pair each class of seed with the type of human heart:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Seed along the path illustrates people who do not grasp the
message about the kingdom of God.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This raises some interesting questions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In the parable, "It sprang up quickly" is "someone who hears the word."
Did the person experience the life of Christ and then fall away? The
defender of eternal security would say they never were a believer in
the first place, but is that a sound interpretation? The defensor of
eternal security will say that it is sound, because it supports the
desired narrative and fits in with the interpretive lens of eternal
security. However, it appears that in contrast to the individual who
simply did not understand the message, this person actually did, and
this person bore evidence of the new life in Christ; and that this
person failed to persevere.</li>
<li>What does "fall away" mean? The eternal security ally would say that
such a person only looked like a genuine beleiver, but really wasn't in
the first place. But, how can one "fall away" if they were not first
connected to Christ in the first place?</li>
</ol>
<p>
The seed on rocky ground seems to represent individuals who fall away from
their salvation due to external pressures (trouble or persecution). For
simplicity, we may call this the <i>weak Christian</i>, since he cannot endure
the trouble or persecution.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Seed falling among thorns is paired with individuals who fail to persevere
due to a temporal, worldly perspective obscuring their perspective on
things eternal.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parable text</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Explanation</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
22 The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word,
but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the
word, making it unfruitful.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Like the weak Christian, this, worldly Christian exhibits the new life,
but fails to persevere. This new life is choked out (it could not be
choked out if it was not alive in the first place) because this new
believer is distracted from things eternal by things of the world.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Seed falling on good soil represents fruitful Christians.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parable text</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred,
sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Explanation</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
23 But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word
and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a
hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defender of eternal security may suggest that since the fruitful
Christian is described as one who hears and understands the message, the
weak Christian (group 2) and the worldly Christian (group 3) did not
understand the message and were not truly Christian in the first
place. However, since Christ spoke of this seed germinating and groups 2
and 3 also hearing, they have more in common with the fruitful Christian
(group 4) than group 1 (those who did not understand). It is more likely
that groups 2 and 3 really were Christians, and they understood the
message, but not to the same extent that the Christians of group 4
did. The fruitful Christians understood that Christ is their very life,
and they held on to the end; but groups 2 and 3 did not fully grasp this,
and they were persuaed by difficult external circumstances or a misguided
heart that to abandon Christ would be better than to endure.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The defender of eternal security may interpret this to be a warning
against fruitlessness rather than an indication about the loss of one's
salvation. Nonetheless, this indicates an individual can fall away from
Christ.
</p>

<p>
The next passage raises the stakes and gives a firm warning against
fruitlessness, indicating dire consequences for fruitlessness because of a
failure to abide in Christ.

<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A1-8&amp;version=RSVCE">John 15:1-8 (RSVCE)</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
15 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch of
mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear
fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 3 You are already made clean by
the word which I have spoken to you. 4 <b>Abide in me, and I in you.</b> As the
branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can
you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He who
abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me
you can do nothing. 6 <b>If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a
branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and
burned.</b> 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you
will, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this my Father is glorified, that
you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This passage is taken from St. John's narrative of the Last Supper, and
Jesus' disciples were present. These were His inner circle, the Twelve
Apostles. Jesus conditions the bearing of fruit with abiding in Him, and He
commands the Twelve to abide in Him. Several interesting questions arise
here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why would Jesus command the Twelve to abide in Him if it were impossible
for them to stop abiding in Him?</li>
<li>Why does Christ warn about <i>not abiding</i> in Him if it were impossible to
stop abiding in Him?</li>
<li>Furthermore, why would Jesus warn about the consequences of not abiding in
Him if it were impossible to stop abiding in Him?</li>
<li>What are the consequences of failing to abide in Jesus?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What does it mean to wither away?</li>

3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately,
saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming
and of the close of the age?” 4 And Jesus answered them, “*Take heed that no
one leads you astray*. 5 For  many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the
Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will hear of wars and
rumors of wars; see that you are not  alarmed; for this must take place, but
the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places:
8 all this is but the beginning of the sufferings.
</p>

<p>
9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and
you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then <b>many will
fall away</b>, and betray one another, and hate one another. 11 And many false
prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because wickedness is
multiplied, most men’s love will grow cold. 13 But <b>he who endures to the end

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some key questions arise here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why would Jesus have warned His disciples of being led astray if that were
not possible?</li>
<li>Why would Christ have been warning about <span class="underline">falling away</span> if that were not
possible?</li>
<li>What does <i>falling away</i> mean? How can one <i>fall away</i> if they were never
joined to Christ in the first place?</li>
<li>Does verse 13 inicate that it is possible to fail to endure to the end?
This <span class="underline">does not</span> say <i>he who is saved endures to the end</i> (i.e., that
salvation determines endurace as in the Calvinist or Baptist
undrstanding), but rather that <i>endurace merits salvation</i>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A9-10&amp;version=ESV">Romans 5:9-10 (ESV)</a>. I've chosen a Protestant translation here, so that we
can avoid any potential Catholic translation bias. It reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall
we be saved by him from the wrath of God. 10 For if while we were enemies we
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are
reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This provides some really interesting material. The Catholic and Protestant
can agree that that we are justified by Christ's blood, and that we are
reconciled by the death of God's son. Now, the defender of eternal security
and some Protestants will disagree. One will say that salvation is complete
at this point, but this text raises some problems: after reconciliation by
Christ's death, the passage indicates that there is still a <i>further</i> or
<i>subsequent</i> or <i>more complete</i> salvation that is wrought by the life of
Christ.
</p>

<p>
In the view of <i>sola fide</i> and eternal security, this passage is very
difficult to interpret. What additional salvation is required apart from that
brought by the blood of Christ? According to this view, Christ's death
completes human salvation, and there is nothing that can be added to
this. But, why, then, does this passage suggest that Christ's life saves us
<i>after</i> reconcilliation with Christ by His death?
</p>

<p>
This is resolved in the Catholic view. Indeed, Christ's death (blood) has
reconciled us to God. Yet, we have free will and the capacity to turn away
from God before death. In order to persevere to the end of our lives, we need
supernatural help from God: this is sanctifying grace (the life of Christ),
which is given to us in the Sacraments. Partaking of the Sacraments with a
proper disposition (not in a state of willful and mortal sin) gives us
the power to live the Christian life, as well as the restoration to that life
if we should forsake it through mortal sin. When we approach the Sacraments
with the proper disposition&#x2013;indeed, one of repentance from sin and
cooperation with His grace, not in pride and rebellion&#x2013;we are transformed
and drawn near to God. Our will and cooperation with His grace builds us up
and brings us toward Him, breaking the power of sin in our lives and
conforming ourselves to the likeness of Christ. This is how the life of Christ
saves us, building on the reconcilliation we have with God through His death.

<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2011&amp;version=RSVCE">Romans 11 (RSVCE)</a>. Paul describes the rebellion of Israel against God and
their rejection of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
11:1 I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an
Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. &#x2026;
11 So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their
trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. 12
Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means
riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
</p>

<p>
13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the
Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 14 in order to make my fellow Jews jealous,
and thus save some of them. 15 For if their rejection means the
reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from
the dead? 16 If the dough offered as first fruits is holy, so is the whole
lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
</p>

<p>
17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot,
were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive tree, 18 do
not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not you that
support the root, but the root that supports you. 19 You will say, “Branches
were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 20 That is true. They were
broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through
faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. 21 <b>For if God did not spare
the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</b> 22 Note then the kindness
and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but <b>God’s
kindness to you, <span class="underline">provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too
will be cut off</span>.</b> 23 And even the others, if they do not persist in their
unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in
again. 24 For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree,
and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more
will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Paul promises and warns his readers, who are Gentile believers, that
they will be cut off from God if they do not continue in His kindness. This
follows from his discussion that God has even cut off the Jews, the
recipients of His old covenant, because of their disbelief and
disobedience. <b>The Christians, Paul says, are no more secure than the Jews.</b>
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206%3A4-7&amp;version=RSVCE">Hebrews 6:4-7 (RSVCE)</a>. The writer describes individuals who have truly tasted
the heavenly gift and partaken of the Holy Spirit, and then fall away.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
4 For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those <span class="underline">who have once
been enlightened</span>, who <span class="underline">have tasted the heavenly gift</span>, and <b>have become
partakers of the Holy Spirit</b>, 5 and have <span class="underline">tasted the goodness of the word of
God and the powers of the age to come</span>, 6 if they then commit apostasy, since
they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to
contempt. 7 For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and
brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated,
receives a blessing from God. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a very interesting and powerful verse, for it speaks of those cannot
be <span class="underline">restored</span> <b>after</b> having become <span class="underline">partakers of the Holy Spirit</span>, having
<span class="underline">tasted of the goodness of God</span> and having come to <span class="underline">know the powers of the
age to come</span>.
</p>

<p>
Proponents of eternal security would attempt to argue that these individuals
only <i>appeared</i> to be saved, but it was the case that they were never saved
in the first place. Some have even suggested to me in dialog that these
people were not enlightened by the Holy Spirit, despite the fact that the
text says they were enlightened and partakers of the Holy Spirit before
needing an (impossible) restoration. It would be pointless to talk of
<i>restoration</i> if the person had not initially been in a state of grace.
</p>

<p>
Some have responded to this verse by saying that it's complex, unclear, and can be
interpreted in many ways. This response is not adequate, because it does not
suggest an interpretation that supports eternal security, but only attempts
to obscure a verse that reads in a simple way to cast <b>significant doubt</b>
upon eternal security.

Philippians 3:7-14 (RSVCE). St. Paul speaks of <span class="underline">not already having attained</span>
his goal, and not already having become perfected. He wanrs us to keep
striving, like he does, to attain the <span class="underline">resurrection from the dead</span>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed
I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count
them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not
having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through
faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith; 10 that I
may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings,
becoming like him in his death, 11 that if possible I may attain the
resurrection from the dead. 
</p>

<p>
12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on
to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13 Brethren, I
do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what
lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on toward the
goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Let those of us
who are mature be thus minded; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, God
will reveal that also to you. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A16-17&amp;version=RSVCE">1 John 5:16-17 (RSVCE)</a>. In verses 16-17, St. John speaks of mortal sin: "16 If any one sees
his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God will
give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is
mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin,
but there is sin which is not mortal." Protestant Bible translations tend to
render "mortal" as "sin leading to death". The important question is, what
does <i>mortal</i> mean? It is helpful to notice that the context of this verse is
in a discussion where St. John equates eternal life with a relationship with
the Son of God (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A11-13&amp;version=RSVCE">11-13</a>): to possess the Son of God is to have eternal life
(see also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A1-3&amp;version=RSVCE">John 17:1-3</a>, where eternal life is equated with <b>knowing Jesus and
the Father Who sent Him</b>). What, then, is death? It the opposite of being in
relationship with and posessing the Son of God and having eternal life: it is
separation from the Son of God, and being bereft of eternal life. Thus,
commiting mortal sin is the tearing away of oneself from union with God, and
thus the loss of eternal life.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is <span class="underline">not</span> that life is given to us in an eternal (timeless) and
irrevocable manner; rather, eternity is a quality of the life that is given
to us, and this life is none other than Jesus. We still have the opportunity
to fail to abide in that life, and by our mortal sin to reject this life,
which is eternal. In other words, <i>eternal</i> does not describe the way in
which the life is given; rather, it describes the life itself, which is
Jesus, Who is eternal. Nowhere in the Scriptures nor the tradition which gave
us the Scripture does it say that our relationship with Christ is unbreakable
by our own high-handed disobedience. Rather, we are left with a significant
corpus of Scripture and tradition that indicates that our relationship with
Christ can be lost through mortal sin or apostasy.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Catholic Answers has an excellent article: <a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#">What the Early Church Believed:
Mortal Sin</a>. This provides important context, because in the case of the Didache,
these authors wrote the Scriptures (in the case of the Didache), or played
important roles in the establishing of the Canon of Scripture identified in the
late 4th Century.
</p>

<p>
Additional Scriptures that proponents of eternal security use as "proof texts"
for this dogma include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A27-30&amp;version=RSVCE">John 10:27-30 (RSVCE)</a>. "27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they
follow me; 28 and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and
no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to
me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the
Father’s hand." Proponents of eternal security may argue that if one could
lose his salvation, then that life is not eternal. Or, they may point to the
statement that no one may be snatched from the saving hand of Christ or God
the Father.
</p>

<p>
While this passage clearly teaches that a person's salvation cannot be
disrupted by a third party, it <span class="underline">does not</span> clearly refute the idea that a
person could walk away from their own salvation, that is to willingly crawl
out of the saving hand of God. This possibility is left open.
</p>

<p>
Another interpretation is that the eternal life given is in fact not eternal
if it can be lost. We have already dealt with this point above, where we
discuss John's own understanding of eternal ife as relationship with Jesus,
for Jesus Himself is our life. <i>Eternal life</i> does not necessarily mean that
life is given eternally, but that the life (Jesus) which is given to us is
eternal. Other Scriptures (discussed above) leave open the possibiltiy of
severing our relationship with Christ through mortal sin or failing to bear
fruit.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010%3A14&amp;version=RSVCE">Hebrews 10:14 (RSVCE)</a>. "14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all
time those who are sanctified."
</p>

<p>
Proponents of eternal security suggest that this past-tense language of
having perfected believing Christians once and for all, so that salvation is
a "one and done" deal. Yet, when read in context, this passage is not about
eternal security. Hebrews 10 compares the sacrifice of Christ to the animal
sacrifices of the old covenant. The animal sacrifices had to be repeated on a
yearly basis, and it could not actually absolve sins; Christ's sacrifice
occured only once, and it is done and efficacious for saving Christians.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, St. Paul speaks of <i>not being perfected yet</i> in Philippians 3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
8 Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all
things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be
found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that
which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on
faith; 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may
share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that <i>if possible I
may attain the resurrection from the dead</i>.
</p>

<p>
12 <span class="underline">Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect</span>; but I press
on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13
Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do,
forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I
press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>
In summary, the challenges to eternal security are great. While some passages
even suggest that salvation can be lost, no passage decisively says that a
Christian cannot reject his salvation. Based on the lack of evidence for eternal
security, it seems very difficult to defend the concept.
</p>

<p>
At this point, as so many doctrinal discussions do, it comes down to
interpretations. The Baptist/Calvinist interpretation is for eternal security;
the Arminian interpretation is against eternal security. Under the dogma of
<i>sola scriptura</i>, there is no resolution here, or it would have been resolved
hundreds of years ago. Fortunately, Christ did not leave us with <i>sola
scriptura</i> and only the Scriptures to detetermine our doctrine infallibly; He
gave us a Church, and instructed us to hand down the faith through Her teaching
(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A16-20&amp;version=RSVCE">Matthew 28:16-20</a>). This was the very Church that raised up disciples and martyrs, endured
persecution, and after hundreds of years, identified the Scriptures as those
writings which could be read in the liturgy. The Church has the testimony of the
authors of scripture, as well as the testimony of those Christians to whom the
Scriptures were written. Eternal security was not part of Christian teaching
historically and only emerged within the context of the Protestant Reformation
with the likes of John Calvin.

<p>
<b>The Origin of the Protestant Doctrine of Eternal Security</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
The dogma of <b>eternal security*—the belief that a person who is truly saved
cannot lose their salvation—did not exist as a formalized doctrine in the
earliest centuries of Christianity. It developed over time, with its clearest
articulation emerging during the *Protestant Reformation</b>, particularly in
<b>Calvinist theology</b> in the 16th century.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Historical Development</span>:
</p>

<p>
<i>Early Christianity (1st–5th centuries)</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius of Antioch, Origen, Tertullian,
Augustine) generally believed that salvation could be lost through serious sin
or apostasy.</li>
<li>The Christian life was seen as a process requiring perseverance; passages like
Hebrews 6:4–6 and Matthew 24:13 were interpreted to mean believers must remain
faithful to the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Medieval Period (5th–15th centuries)</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Western Church (later Roman Catholic) maintained that <b>grace can be
lost</b> through mortal sin, but restored through repentance and the sacraments
(especially confession).</li>
<li>No concept resembling "once saved, always saved" was part of official doctrine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Protestant Reformation (16th century)</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Martin Luther</b> taught justification by faith alone, but did not emphasize
eternal security in the Calvinist sense.</li>
<li><b>John Calvin</b> developed the doctrine of the *perseverance of the saints*—-a core
part of his theology (TULIP). He taught that those whom God elects will
inevitably persevere in faith and cannot fall away.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is the clearest root of the modern doctrine of <b>eternal security</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Other Reformers</b> (like the Anabaptists and later Arminians) rejected this and
emphasized the possibility of falling from grace.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Post-Reformation and Evangelical Movements</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Arminianism</b> (developed by Jacobus Arminius, early 17th century) opposed
Calvinism and taught that believers could lose their salvation.</li>
<li>In the 18th–19th centuries, some evangelical groups (especially Baptists and
later dispensationalists) promoted <b>eternal security</b> as a central tenet.</li>
<li>The <b>"once saved, always saved"</b> slogan is especially common in modern
evangelical and fundamentalist circles, particularly among Southern Baptists.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Summary</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>formal doctrine</b> of eternal security <b>arose during the Reformation</b> (16th
century) and is especially associated with <b>John Calvin</b>.</li>
<li>It was not held by the early Church or the medieval Church.</li>
<li>It remains a <b>point of disagreement</b> between different Christian traditions
(e.g., Calvinism vs. Arminianism, Protestantism vs. Catholicism/Orthodoxy).</li>
</ul>
</details>

</div>

<p>
Proponents of <i>sola fide</i> also may make a distinction between justification and
sanctification. Justification is a process by which a human is declared
righteous and qualified for salvation, despite personal flaws and moral
imperfection. Justification is believed by <i>sola-fide</i>-ists to be independent of
works, but sanctification&#x2013;the process of becoming holy and Christ-like&#x2013;is not
necessary for salvation.
</p>

<p>
In view of the fact that salvation (justification) is by faith alone through
grace alone, another belief is common among proponents of <i>sola fide</i>: that the
Gospel (Good News of salvation) depends on faith, not works; and, anyone who
trust in anything else for salvation apart from faith is condemned. This is
directly supported by a verse from Paul the Apostle in the <i>Epistle to the
Galatians</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus
Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified! 2 The only thing I want to learn
from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by
believing what you heard? 3 Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit,
are you now ending with the flesh? 4 Did you experience so much for nothing?—if
it really was for nothing. 5 Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit
and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your
believing what you heard? 
</p>

<p>
Just as Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” 
so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham. And the
scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the
gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the Gentiles shall be blessed in
you.” For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who
believed. 
</p>

<p>
For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is
written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
written in the book of the law.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
before God by the law; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[b] 12
But the law does not rest on faith; oMn the contrary, “Whoever does the works of
the law will live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a
tree”— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to
the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

<div id="outline-container-orgd4e7907" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd4e7907">Evidence Against <i>Sola Fide</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd4e7907">
<p>
The first and most importnat an important piece of evidence against <i>sola fide</i>
is found in the body of Scripture itself:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You see that a person is <b>justified by works</b> and <b>not by faith alone</b>. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A24&amp;version=NRSVCE">James 2:24
(NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interestingly, this is the <b>only place</b> in <i>all of the Christian Scriptures</i> where
the "faith alone" is used, and it clearly states that salvation is <b>not</b> by
faith alone, but rather, <b>works play a role in justification</b>.
</p>

<p>
At its very best, <i>sola fide</i> is not scriptural, but rather <b>antiscriptural</b>,
that is, contrary to the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
The Gospel is <b>not</b> that man is saved by grace alone through faith alone.
</p>

<p>
How can we balance James with the Scriptures mentioned above that indicate works
do not save a person? The Catholic response is that the preponderance of the
above works do not speak about <span class="underline">works in general</span> as being ineffectual, but
rather the <b>works of the law</b> are ineffectual. What are the works of the law?
These are <b>circumcision, animal sacrifices, etc</b>. It is these works of the law
that are inneffectual for salvation, but good works done in <i>charity</i> are in fact
meritorious for salvation.
</p>

<p>
In fact, let us review the above passges and highlight the concept of the <b>works
of the law</b> in them:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A20&amp;version=NRSVCE">Romans 3:20 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For “no human being will be justified in his sight” by deeds prescribed by
the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A27&amp;version=NRSVCE">Romans 3:27 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? By that of works?
No, but by the law of faith.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16&amp;version=NRSVCE">Galatians 2:16 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
yet we know that a person is justified not by the <span class="underline">works of the law</span> but
through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ
Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing
the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the <span class="underline">works of the
law</span>.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A5&amp;version=NRSVCE">Galatians 3:5 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Well then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by
your doing the <span class="underline">works of the law</span>, or by your believing what you heard?
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A10%2D13&amp;version=NRSVCE">Galatians 3:11-13 (NRSVCE)</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For all who rely on the <span class="underline">works of the law</span> are under a curse; for it is
written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things
written in the book of the <span class="underline">law</span>.” Now it is evident that no one is justified
before God by the <span class="underline">law</span>; for “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”[a]
12 But the <span class="underline">law</span> does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the
<span class="underline">works of the law</span> will live by them.” 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, we can see the importance of works for salvation. We start with the words
of Jesus, where he speaks of the judgement of the righteous unto eternal life,
and the unrighteous to damnation, where righteousness is tied to a person's
<i>works</i>: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will
sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and
he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 
</p>

<p>
34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by
my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the
creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I
was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited
me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after
me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’ 
</p>

<p>
37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and
feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a
stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we
see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ 
</p>

<p>
40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the
least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ 
</p>

<p>
41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed,
into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry
and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did
not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’

<p>
44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a
stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’
</p>

<p>
45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the
least of these, you did not do for me.’

<p>
46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal
life."
</p>

<p>
(Matthew 15:31-46 NIV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
St. Paul also indicates that a person must work toward salvation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much
more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for
it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure." 
(Philippians 2:12-13 NIV).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Additionally, John speaks of the judgment of all the dead:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and
the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12 And I
saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged
according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13 The sea gave up the
dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them,
and each person was judged according to what they had done. 14 Then death and
Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second
death. 15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown
into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15, NIV)

<b>The Mass is Mind-blowing</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read this to have your mind blown ...</summary>

<p>
Central to the Mass is the Eucharist, which we believe is truly the Body, Blood,
Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ. This reality makes present the Paschal
mystery, which is an act of God that happened in our history and yet transcends
time. This is discussed in paragraph <a href="https://www.catholiccrossreference.online/catechism/#!/search/1085">1085</a> of the Catechism of the Catholic
Church:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal mystery that
Christ signifies and makes present. During his earthly life Jesus announced his
Paschal mystery by his teaching and anticipated it by his actions. When his Hour
comes, he lives out the unique event of history which does not pass away: Jesus
dies, is buried, rises from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of the
Father "once for all."8 His Paschal mystery is a real event that occurred in our
history, but it is unique: all other historical events happen once, and then
they pass away, swallowed up in the past. The Paschal mystery of Christ, by
contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because by his death he destroyed
death, and all that Christ is — all that he did and suffered for all men —
participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends all times while being
made present in them all. The event of the Cross and Resurrection abides and
draws everything toward life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What does this mean to me? It means that when I partake of the Eucharist, I am
uniting myself with the eternal Christ in the present moment. I am not communing
with Christ and just those people around me; rather, in Christ, I am communing with all
Christians&#x2013;past, present, future, near and far&#x2013;who also have joined themselves
to Jesus. <i>The Mass transcends space and time.</i>
</p>

<p>
The Mass is a cosmic event in which our Creator approaches us, gives Himself to
us, and we approach Him. In receiving His Body and Blood, we also give ourselves
to Him in an encounter that is more intimate than any act that spouses can
perform.
</p>

<p>
Eastern Orthodox Christians also believe their liturgy (public worship) to be a
cosmic event where heaven meets earth and angels participate. This is because
they&#x2013;like Catholics, Coptics, Armenians, and many other Christians&#x2013;believe
that Christ is truly present in the consecrated bread and wine. What Catholics
call the <i>Mass</i>, Orthodox Christians call the  <i>Divine Liturgy</i>. In the video
below, an Eastern Orthodox Christian describes the Divine Liturgy in much the
same way we Catholics view the Mass. The Mass is full of mystery and Divine
love.

<p>
Like the Orthodox Christians, if we truly
understood the Mass, we would approach it with great awe and wonder, recognizing
it as a holy and intimate encounter with the Creator of the universe, our great
Divine Lover, and the Source of our very lives. In the Mass, we come into
contact with Him who is both our Origin and our Destination.

<h3 id="orgb8aeebc">An Interpretive Lens: the Eucharist</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb8aeebc">
<p>
Understanding the Eucharist&#x2013;that is, the elements of Communion&#x2013;is perhaps the
most important key to understanding the Catholic Mass and the Catholic
worldview. Common among the apostolic Christians is the belief that <b>Jesus
Christ is truly present in the elements of Communion</b>, called <b>the Eucharist</b> in
the Catholic Church. By <i>apostolic Christians</i>, we mean the Christian churches
established throughout the centuries <i>prior</i> to the Protestant Reformation, such
as the Armenians, the Copts, the Syro-Malabar Christians, the Greek Orthodox,
the Russian Orthodox, etc. 
</p>


<div id="orgcf57d10" class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/holy-eucharist-992x480_jpg_1200x.webp.jpeg" alt="holy-eucharist-992x480_jpg_1200x.webp.jpeg" width="640px" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Catholics and generally all ancient apostolic Christians sects founded prior to the Protestant Reformation accept the teaching that the Eucharist (the elements of Communion) truly are the flesh and blood of Christ. This teaching is derived from the teachings of Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-71&amp;version=RSVCE">John 6:22-71 RSVCE</a>, the writings of St. Paul, the earliest believers&#x2013;such as St. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John the Evangelist (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">Epistle to the Smyrnaeans</a>, ch. 6-7), and numerous <a href="https://www.churchfathers.org/the-real-presence">church fathers</a>. Additionally, several Protestant founders such as <a href="https://www.detroitcatholic.com/voices/luther-s-defense-of-the-real-presence-in-the-eucharist">Martin Luther</a>, John Calvin, and others upheld the teaching of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</p>
</div>


<p>
The belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the elements of the 
Eucharist is referred to the <i>Real Presence</i> of Christ in the Eucharist. Among
churches that hold to the Real Presence, there are a subtle variety of vies. The
specific version of the Real Presence taught by the Catholic  church involves
<i>transubstantiation</i>.
</p>

<p>
Transubstantiation means that what <b>looks</b> like bread is God. Initially, it was
was made as bread. It has all the outward appearances (technically, called the
<i>accidents</i>) of bread, and in its essence or <i>substance</i>, it is bread. However,
at the words of consecration ("This is my body" or "This is the cup of my
blood"), bread and wine are changed in substance from bread and wine to the very
flesh and blood of God.
</p>

<p>
For apostolic Christians, this means that being in the presence of the Eucharist
is a very holy occasion, since it is the very presence of Jesus Christ, the
living God. This makes such occasions every bit as holy as the encounter Moses
had with the burning bush:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the
mountain of God. 2 And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire
from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with
fire, but the bush was not consumed. 3 Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside
and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.” 
</p>

<p>
4 So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the
midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” 
</p>

<p>
And he said, “Here I am.”
</p>

<p>
5 Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet,
for the place where you stand is holy ground.” 6 Moreover He said, “I am the God
of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

<h3 id="org5c900a8">The Mass as an Intimate Dance with God</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c900a8">
<p>
Because of the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the Mass provides a real
and intimate way for us to have contact with our Lord. I like to think of it as
an intimate dance with the Divine, or perhaps as a call and response between a
Divne lover, and me, His beloved.
</p>

<p>
The Mass can be divided roughly into two parts: the Liturgy of the Word, and the
Liturgy of the Eucharist. <b>We can think of the Liturgy of the Word as God's
divine call to us, and the Liturgy of the Eucharist as our human response to
God's call.</b> In the Liturgy of the Word, we hear God's call to obey or respond
in faith. In the Liturgy of the Eucharist, we offer the sacrifice of prayer and
the very Body and Blood of Christ to God the Father on our behalf. This
culminates in our reception of the Eucharist, in which we respond to God by
receiving Him into our bodies in an act more intimate than even the marital act
between husband and wife. In so doing, we must be properly disposed to receivng
Christ. In this moment, Christ gives Himself fully and completely to us, and we
give ourselves fully and compeletly to Christ, with a commitment to obey Him.
</p>

<p>
We expand further on these two parts of the Mass.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0b268ae" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0b268ae">The Liturgy of the Word</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0b268ae">
<p>
The Liturgy of the Word  contains the introductory rites and readings of
Scripture. It culminates with a reading from the Gospel, for which we stand in
honor of Jesus, acknowledging His presence (non-Eucharistic) in the reading of
the Gospels (the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The 
ligurgy of the Word then typically concludes 
with a homily, in which the priest helps us connect the readings with our
present lives and draws on how we may apply the Word of God personally
today. Depending on the day of the week or the liturgical calendar, there may be
a profession of the Nicene creed. This completes the divine call in the Liturgy
of the Word.
</p>

<div class="note" id="org7f4d8dd">
<p>
<b>The Word of God</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
The <b>word of God</b> is typically interpreted in two ways: (1) as either Scriptures
(writings) or a spoken word, or (2) as Jesus Christ Himself.
</p>

<p>
Christians consider the Scriptures to be the divinely-inspired Word of God in written form. Here, when
you see <i>Word</i>, think <i>revelation</i> of God. The fullest revelation of God is
Jesus Christ, God in human form. See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1-18&amp;version=RSVCE">John 1:1-18</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A1-3&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, Hebrews 4:12 is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as a reference
to the Bible. A close reading of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A12-13&amp;version=RSVCE">Hebrews 4:12-13</a> reveals that Jesus is the subject
here, not a collection of writings:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword,
piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And before him no
creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom
we have to do. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In verse 12, the English "word" is λόγος (<i>logos</i>) in the Greek, and this is
these same λόγος as in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&amp;version=RSVCE">John 1:1</a>, which is none other than Jesus Christ, our
Lord.  Additionally, verse 13 uses the pronoun <i>him</i>, referring back to the
previous subject, the λόγος of God.

<h4 id="orgbf44f64">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbf44f64">
<p>
After the homily, we transition to the liturgy of the Eucharist. The climax of
the liturgy of the Eucharist is when the priest consecrates the bread and wine,
transforming it to the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, followed by the personal
reception of the Body and Blood by the Catholic faithful. When receiving the
Eucharist, we are declaring with our actions that we believe in all the
teachings of the Catholic Church, and we are offering ourselves to God, just as
He offers Himself to us in the Eucharist. We highlight several
parts of the liturgy of the Eucharist::
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It may begin with a period of <i>intercession</i>, where the church prays together
for various needs.</li>
<li>Then, there will be an offering of the people (an offering collection plate
or basket is passed around), and the bread and wine that will become the Body
and Blood of Jesus at the <i>Consecration</i>.  The bread and wine also are
regarded as <i>gifts</i> from the faithful</li>
<li>The priest then prepares the gifts to serve as the offering. He says prayers
for himself and the people and the church.</li>
<li>Finally, when the altar is prepared, the priest invites us to pray with him
for what will become a sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood in Eucharistic
form to God. We stand and respond in prayer, finally concluding with "Holy,
Holy, Holy, is the Lord God almighty. Heaven and earth are full of Your
glory. Hosana in the highest. Hosana in the highest." Then, we kneel as the
priest undrtakes the holiest part of the Mass, the Consecration of the gifts.</li>
<li><p>
The Consecration begins with prayers by the priest. He shows the bread to the
faithful and recites teh words of Jesus, bowing. WHen says, "This is my
Body," we believe that the Holy Spirit works through the priest to
transubstantiate the bread: it is no longer bread, but God Himself, in His
fullness&#x2013;Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. The consecration of the bread is
followed by the priest elevating the Body of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the priest consecrates the wine with the words of Jesus, "&#x2026; this
is the chalice of my blood &#x2026;", followed by an elevation.
</p></li>
<li>Next, we pray the Lord's prayer, inviting God to be Lord of our lives with
the words, "&#x2026;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done&#x2026;"</li>
<li><p>
Following this, the Catholic faithful are invited to receive the Body and
Blood of Christ. This is the most intimate interaction we can have with God
in this present life, and far more intimate than any act of intimacy we can
perform with another human.
</p>

<p>
Non-Catholics and Catholics not properly prepared to receive the Eucharist
also may approach, but they should not receive. Catholics and 
non-Catholics alike can indicate their intention <b>not to receive</b> by crossing
their arms in front of their chest. The priest or Eucharistic minister will
then give a blessing. I recommend non-Catholics and unprepared Catholics
still approach the priest or Eucharistic minister, since this allows a better
flow of people. The faithful return to their pews and kneel reverently in
prayer of thanksgiving for the great and intimate gift of Christ's Body that
He himself gives us.
</p></li>
<li>The priest will then cleanse the sacred vessels, give closing prayers and a
blessing, and dismiss the Mass with the words, "Mass is ended. Go in peace."</li>

The Catholic teaching is that the Mass is a holy sacrifice. Actually, it is
two-fold. One sacrifice is by the priest, who sacrifices the Body and Blood of Jesus to God the Father on
behalf of the Church. The other sacrifice is that of the lay faithful, who
present their bodies to God as a living offering, in accordance with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A1-2&amp;version=NKJV">Romans

The Easter Triduum (Latin for "three days") is an incredibly immersive and
engaging experience of Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. These three
days commemorate the Paschal Mystery, a Divine and transcendent event that took
place in human history and yet transcends time and space. This is the
most intesive and elevated part of Catholic worship throughout the year. While
Christmas is a grand celebration, Easter is even more so in sorrow, mourning,

<p>
This Mass deosn't end with the words, "Mass is ended. Go in peace." Instead, it
ends in silence. Typically, the priest will consecrate extra Eucharist for use
on Good Friday (the Solemn Liturgy of the Lord's Passion), a day when no Mass is
held throughout the world. Instead of ending the Mass explicitly, the extra
Eucharist is taken to an altar of repose in a solemn procession. There, Christ
will be adored by the lay faithful, who will wait with Him. The idea here is to
waith with Christ, much like His disciples did during His agony in the Garden of
Gethsemane in the time leading up to His betrayal, but without falling asleep.
</p>

<p>
It is a tradition for parishes to keep their altar of repose open until midnight.

This is not a Mass because the Eucharist is not consecrated on Good Friday
around the world. Instead, consecrated hosts from the Holy Thursday Mass are
distributed so that the faithful may receive Christ on this day. The Liturgy
includes a long set of intercessions for the world, as well as a prayer called
the Litany of the Saints. Additionally, there is a ceremony called the
Veneration of the Cross, where the faithful and the clergy express their
gratitude to Jesus by showing reverence to a crucifix as a sign of Christ's
generous love for us. For a church with hundreds of attendees, this can be a
lengthy protion of the Liturgy. The Ligurgy concludes after the faithful receive
the Eucharist.

The Easter Vigil Mass is the pinnacle of the liturgical year. It is the Mass of
Masses. Even more than Good Friday was a somber reflection of Christ's, passion,
the Easter Vigil is full of expectant desire of His Resurrection, and jubilant
triumph over the historical fact of the matter. This is the first Mass since
Holy Thursday, and the readings give a grand panoramic view of salvation
history, starting with Creation and the Fall, up through the Resurrection and
the present day. Themes of light and dark are used, starting with an Easter
candle and the lighting of candles. The use of fire recalls God's deliverance of
Israel through the Red Sea as a pillar of fire, as well as the fact that Christ
is the very Light of Life. This Mass starts in darkness and in candle light, and
then full lighting to reflect the transition from the Old Testament to the New
Testament.

are some of the <a href="https://www.usccb.org/prayer-worship/liturgical-year/easter/easter-proclamation-exsultet">lyrics</a> from the <i>Exultet</i> that always grip me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is the night,
when once you led our forebears, Israel's children,
from slavery in Egypt
and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
This is the night
that with a pillar of fire
banished the darkness of sin.
</p>

<p>
This is the night
that even now, throughout the world,
sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices
and from the gloom of sin,
leading them to grace
and joining them to his holy ones.
</p>

<p>
This is the night,
when Christ broke the prison-bars of death
and rose victorious from the underworld.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>Exultet</i> continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
O truly blessed night,
worthy alone to know the time and hour
when Christ rose from the underworld!
</p>

<p>
This is the night
of which it is written:
The night shall be as bright as day,
dazzling is the night for me,
and full of gladness.
</p>

<p>
The sanctifying power of this night
dispels wickedness, washes faults away,
restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners,
drives out hatred, fosters concord, and brings down the mighty. 
</p>

<p>
The <b>Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</b>, often abbreviated to the <i>Real
Presence</i>, is the teaching or belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the
elements of Communion. This is to be contrasted with a more symbolist view,
which was first espoused by Ulrich Zwingli in the first Zurich disputation
(January 1523).
</p>

<p>
Today, many more evangelical Protestant denominations hold to
the Zwinglian symbolist view. However, the Real Presence has been the view
upheld by Church fathers since the writing of the Gospels, the early decades of
the Church, and down through the centuries. It is so prevalent that all
apostolic Christian churches&#x2013;those churches established prior to the Protestant
Reformation, such as the Armenians, the Copts, the Chaldeans, the Greek
Orthodox, Ethiopean Orthodox, etc.&#x2013;all uphold the Real Presence in a corporeal
sense. Additionally, Martin Luther himself upheld the Real Presence in debate
against Zwingli's symbolist position. John Calvin and John Wesley are other
notable Protestant leaders and founders who believed in and taught a form of the
Real Presence, though they espoused a more spiritual version of the Real
Presence. Zwingli's symbolist view emerged as a significant unorthodox
theological novelty after the Real Presence dominated Chistian thought and 
teaching for the first 16 centuries of Christianity. In the symbolist view, the
Real Presence is rejected, and communion is simply a rememberance of Christ's
passion.

<b>The Real Presence and Transubstantiation</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>More information ...</summary>

<p>
The Real Presence refers to the teaching that Christ is truly present in the
elements of Communion of which we as Christians partake. The Catholic teaching
is a <i>corporeal</i> real presence, since the Catholic Church teaches that the
Eucharist is Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. In particular, the Catholic
teaching is called <b>transubstantiation</b>. This means that the <i>substance</i> or
<i>essence</i> of the elements of communion&#x2013;that is, what they <span class="underline">are</span>&#x2013;has been
changed from the substance of bread and wine to the substance of God Himself in
the Second Person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ. The bread and wine are gone, and
all that is present is Jesus Christ Himself, even though the Eucharist retains the
<i>accidents</i> of bread and wine. <i>Accidents</i> are those properties that can be
physically experienced, measured, or observed. Thus according to the doctrine of
transubstantiation, we can never tell from appearances or even intense study
that the Eucharist is anything other than Bread and Wine; however, because of
the testimony of Jesus Christ Himself, we receive by faith that the Eucharist is
actually Christ. Additionally, the Eucharist is not a part of Christ (not a
finger or a piece of skin or a portion of liver); rather it is <i>all</i> of Christ
in a non-extensible way. By non-extensible, we mean that if we receive two
Eucharistic hosts, we do not receive twice as much of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Within Christianity, a broad range of views pertaining to the Real Presence
persist. Here is a brief listing of some various non-Catholic views:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Eastern Orthodoxy. Eastern Orthodox churches share a similar belief in the
real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but they do not use the term
"transubstantiation" and do not explicitly define the manner of the change.</li>
<li>Lutheranism. Lutherans believe in the consubstantiation, where Christ's body
and blood are present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine.</li>
<li>Anglicanism. Anglicans have a wide range of views, from a spiritual presence
to a corporeal presence (similar to Catholicism), with some emphasizing the
real presence as a mystery.</li>
<li>Reformed/Calvinistic Churches. Reformed Christians, including Presbyterian
and Reformed Baptist denominations, believe in a real, but spiritual presence
of Christ in the Eucharist.</li>
<li>Methodism. Methodists generally hold a Reformed view, believing in a real,
spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</li>
<li>Anabaptists, Plymouth Brethren, and some non-denominational Christian
churches. These groups tend to interpret the Eucharist as a symbolic
remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary><b>Watch:</b> <i>What did Calvin think about Communion?</i></summary>

<p>
Dr. David Anders fields a question about whether Buzz Aldrin's communion on the
moon contained the real presence of Christ. He also discusses Calvin's view and
why it arose as compromize between the Lutheran view and the Zwinglian view.

<h3 id="org09cee7d">Scriptural Basis for the Real Presence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org09cee7d">
<p>
Belief in the Real Presence comes from the teachings of Jesus Himself, with
confirmation by St. Paul. Starting with Jesus, He teaches in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-69&amp;version=ESV">John 6:22-69 (ESV)</a>
that He would give believers His flesh and blood to eat and drink. This was an
interactive dialogue, the Greek word Jesus used for "eat" shifts from <i>phago</i>
(φάγω) to <i>trogo</i> (τρώγω). Initially, Jesus uses <i>phago</i>, the common word for
eating, but then switches to <i>trogo</i>, which means to "chew on" or "gnaw on."
This emphasizes the literal nature of consuming his flesh and blood.
</p>

<p>
When this repulsed His audence, He admitted this was a hard saying. Jesus didn't say
they misunderstood Him, nor did he indicate that He was being symbolic. In fact,
many of His followers left Him over this. Jesus let them go and asked the Twelve
Apostles if they, too, were going to leave Him. Later, at the Last Supper, this
is what Jesus said to His disciples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave
it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” 
</p>

<p>
27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink
from it, all of you. 28 For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is
shed for many for the remission of sins.
</p>

<p>
(Matthew 26:26-28 NKJV)

<b>Figurative, or Literal? Does it even matter?</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>
<p>
Some protest that it's not clear whether Christ was being figurative or
literal. It is common to suggest that where the Bible leaves room for
interpretation, the doctrine in question doesn't matter, since it doesn't
pertain to salvation.
</p>

<p>
There are a few issues with this line of thinking.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Christ does not appear to think this issue is insignificant. Jesus would be
rather uncaring if He allowed most of His disciples to leave Him over an
issue that didn't matter. He simply could have said, "Come on, guys. You
don't have to go. It doesn't really matter whether you think I was being
figurative or literal.  You're abandoning the very source of all life itself
over a small matter."</li>
<li>There is no good mechanism for deciding which issues are central or essential
to the Christian faith if all you have is personal interpretations according
to <i>sola scriptura</i>. Some Christians think you have to be baptized to be
save, while others do not; some think drinking alcohol is a grave sin, and
others do not.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since Christ Himself appears to believe that it is important for His disciples
to eat His flesh and drink His blood, it should be important to us to determine
whether He is speaking figuratively or literally. Fortunately, <i>there is</i> a way
to do this. To learn more, see the box below, titled <b>When Interpretations Conflict</b>.
</p>
</details>

</div>


<p>
St. Paul's retelling of the Last Supper also says Jesus told His disciples to
eat of His body:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the
Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; 24 and when He
had given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat; this is My body which is
broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 25 In the same manner He also
took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My
blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” 
</p>

<p>
26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord’s death till He comes.
</p>

<p>
(1 Corinthians 11:23-26 NKJV)

<div class="note" id="orga0b8638">
<p>
<b>When Interpretations Conflict</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>More information ...</summary>

<p>
How can a matter be settled when interpretations conflict? A Catholic may read
John 6 and say, "It is clear that this speaks fo the Real Presence in the
Eucharist." On the other hand, a symbolist may say, "No, it isn't that
clear. There is great reason to believe that Jesus is speaking figuratively."
</p>

<p>
In this case, the dispute is a matter of conflicting interpretations. If
Scripture alone is our ultimate infallible authority, as adherents to the <i>Sola
Scriptura</i> often assert, there is no resolution when two individuals have
conflicting interpretations of the Scriptures. Each man is certain and correct,
because that is what the Holy Spirit spoke to him through the Holy
Scriptures. When interpretations are in direct contradiction, both cannot be
true at the same time according to the logical principle of non-contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Is there any force that can break the stalemate? If the two parties can suspend
their belief in <i>Sola Scriptura</i> momentarily, they may find that indeed, there
are voices and authorities that can help arbitrate between interpretations: the
early <span class="underline">Church fathers</span>! Their voices are particularly important because in many
cases, they lived and wrote within living memory of Christ and His
Apostles. Some of them were pupils of the Apostles and Gospel-writers
themselves. Surely they can help us understand, for example, whether St. John
was capturing Christ's Bread of Life Discourse (John 6) as a literal teaching or
as a more figurative parable.
</p>

<p>
An examplar of this is St. Ignatius of Antioch. He was a pupil of St. John, and
his writings reflect a position well within one camp of the Real-vs-Symbolist
debate to the exclusion of the other. Who better to help us understand whether
St. John intended for us to take Christ's teaching figuratively or literally?
St. Ignatius' testimony is discussed in the next section.

</p>

<p>
The doctrine of the Real Presence also comes with some important historical
evidence. Since John the Evangelist wrote John 6, one of John's students,
Ignatius of Antioch writes clearly about his interpretation of John's work: he
interpret's his teacher's writing in John 6 to be <i>literal</i>, not merely
symbolic. Here is what Ignatius writes about the Real Presence:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect to the grace of
Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God. They
have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed;
of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.
</p>

<p>
They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the
Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our
sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore,
who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes.
</p>

<p>
(Ignatius of Antioch, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">Epistle to the Smyrneans</a>, Chapters 6-7, 106 AD (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">link</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his letter to Christians in Rome, Ignatius wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I
desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the
flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of
David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is
incorruptible love and eternal life.

(Ignatius of antioch, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0107.htm">Epistle to the Romans</a>, Chapter 7, 110 AD)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ignatius' view aligns with a literal understanding of the Bread of Life
Discourse. It is natural to conclude that his view aligns with a literal reading
of his mentor's Gospel because that is the view his mentor taught him to
take. Notably, the epistle quoted above was written within 10 years of the death
of his teacher, and within a few decades of the time when St. John wrote the
<i>Revelation</i>.

Another important early source is by Justin Martyr (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm">First Apology</a>, chapter

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And this food is called among us Εὐχαριστία [the Eucharist], of which no one is
allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are
true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of
sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For
<b>not as common bread and common drink</b> do we receive these; but in like manner as
Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both
flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food
which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh
by transmutation are nourished, <b>is the flesh and blood of that Jesus</b> who was

Satanists hate Christ, and they steal the consecrated Eucharist from Catholic
Churches because they, too, believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the
Eucharist. Note that they do not steal bread from Protestant demonmations
because they know that is merely symbolic. Once stolen, Satanists have Black
Mass ceremonies at which they attempt to torture, profane, and desecrate the
Body of Christ.

Below is a video of a recent attempted Black Mass in Topeak, Kanasas. Just prior
to the desecration, a Catholic man intervened and ate the host. It is not fully
known whether the host was consecrated (actually the Eucharist) or
pre-consecrated (only bread). The Satanists claimed that it was not consecrated,
and that the host was procured legally; however, what people say is not always
true.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9bc646a">
<p>
In Catholicism, we take the Real Presence and transubstantiation to its logical
conclusion. If the consecrated Eucharist is the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity
of Christ, it is Christ Himself. If it is Christ Himself, then He is worthy of
adoration and worship; additionally, it is our privilege to be in the presence
of Christ Himself in the Sacrament of the altar. This is why we decorate our
Tabernacles with gold: to create a dignified resting place for the uncreated
Creator of the universe, Who gives Himself to us. The Eucharist is a symbol that
actually effects what it symbolizes: the Presence of God with us. The Eucharist
is a physical and visible symbol of the truth that our God has drawn near to
us. While the Father and the Holy Spirit have no body, the eternal Son retains
the same divine nature and He has united Himself to a truly human nature in Jesus
Christ. The fact that we can even speak of Him having a Body and Blood is a
consequence of this mysterious union, and the Eucharist makes present this
mystery and this union to us. God has drawn near to us in the incarnation, and
He continues to do so in the Eucharist.
</p>

<p>
Because of this, consecrated Eucharist provides an intimate and holy devotional
encountner for Christians. On occasions where it is possible, Christ in the Holy
Sacrament of the Altar is placed on an instrument called a <b>monstrance</b> so that
His Body is made visible in a dignified way. Faithful Christians are welcomed to
be close to the Sacramental Presence of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I find it very fruitful to spend time in prayer before the Blessed
Sacrament (the Eucharist). It is a beautiful, tranquil, and intimate way to pray
with Jesus. In adoration, I can pray various petitions, or I can simply gaze
upon Christ and meditate on the mysteries of Who He is, and the divine love that
led Him to draw near to us.

<h3 id="org60ba3f9">The Catholic Church Teaches Idolatry</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60ba3f9">
<p>
Protestants may feel that the Catholic Church observes and practices idolatry
through either veneration or or prayers to Mary, the angels, and the saints.
</p>

<p>
There really are two very serious questions here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Is prayer to beings other than God idolatry?</li>
<li>Is the respect shown by Catholics to beings other than God idolatry?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let's discuss these each in turn.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org83e3716" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org83e3716">Prayer to Beings Other than God</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org83e3716">
<p>
To understand this, we must first understand what prayer is. One perspective
non-Catholics may have is that prayer is communication with God, either
silently, or mentally. Therefore, if someone prays to a being other than God,
the supplicant is in a way deifying that non-divine being.
</p>

<p>
If that is what Catholics mean by praying to a non-divine being, then, I, too, 
would object, declare it idolatrous, and I would agree that it should be
avoided. However, this is not what Catholics mean in praying to Mary, other
saints, and angels. 
</p>

<p>
The English word "pray" comes from the Latin <i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precor">precor</a></i>, which means to beseech,
beg, pray, entreat, supplicate, or request. This term is <i>broader</i> than the
modern English use of "pray." In praying to Mary, other saints, and the angles,
Catholics are asking these individuals to pray for us, in the same way that we
ask another living human being to pray for us. Our prayer to non-divine entities
does not deify them, but simply makes a request of them. What request is that?
Their intercession.
</p>

<div class="note" id="orgb786d4b">
<p>
<b>Modern and Old English Usage of "Pray"</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>

<p>
In older English, the term was more widely used to denote a request. For example, in <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/shakescleare/shakespeare-translations/romeo-and-juliet/act-4-scene-3#:~:text=But%2C%20gentle%20Nurse%2C%20I%20pray,cross%20and%20full%20of%20sin.">Act 4, Scene 3</a> of
Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Juliet asks her nurse to leave her alone:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself tonight,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although Juliet uses the word "pray," she is in no way deifying her nurse, nor
committing idolatry.
</p>

<p>
"Pray" also is <a href="https://www.lsd.law/define/pray">used in courtrooms</a> with this more archaic sense as a formal,
legal request.
</p>
</details>

</div>


<p>
The next natural question is whether it is valid to make requests for
intercession of holy, deceased individuals in heaven. Some say that there is no
scriptural precedent for this, so it should not be practiced.

<div id="outline-container-orga47a968" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga47a968">Veneration of Mary and the Saints</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga47a968">
<p>
Catholics hold St. Mary, the other saints, and the angels in high regard. Is
this veneration idolatrous?
</p>

<p>
To understand this, we must understand what idolatry is and how Catholics relate
to these non-divine beings.
</p>

<p>
Idolatry may be defined as worship of another being aside from God. More
practically, it can be understood as the love of a material or created good more
than we love God. There are many material goods we make into idols, but the
often reduce to one of four things: power, pleasure, honor, or wealth. We will
deal here mostly with the worship of beings other than God, though enslavement
to other idols is a concern and separate topic initself.
</p>

<p>
The Catholic understanding of God is that God defines in a category by
Himself. He is infinite, immaterial, and eternal. He is without cause, and we
say God is being itself. There is no existence apart from God. Since God is
immaterial, He has no physical body and is not constrained by the material
universe, and so no image can be made of Him. God is being itself, and, within
Christian revelation, God is three Persons who share in the Divine nature: God
the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Yet, the eternal God has made an
image of Himself for us: Jesus Christ, in which this Divine Person has united a
human nature to His Divine nature in a mysterious way. He fully shares in
Divinity and its eternal nature, and He fully shares in a human nature. It is
possilbe to say that Jesus Christ is eternal in His divine nature, although His
human nature had a beginning and thus is not eternal.
</p>

<div class="note" id="org6d89751">
<p>
<b>More about God and His Nature</b>
</p>

<p>
For more information about the divne nature, see the <a href="https://enriquepacis.github.io/ExploringCatholicism/#what-is-god">What is God?</a> and  <a href="https://enriquepacis.github.io/ExploringCatholicism/#god-is-being">God does
NOT exist!</a> info boxes.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Apart from God, there is no one who is eternal. The angels were created by God,
and so they are in no way equal to God. Even Satan himself is a created being,
and he exists because God wills his existence. Not even St. Mary herself
partakes of the eternal and divine nature. St. Mary had a beginning, and so she
is not eternal. Mary does not share in the divine nature.
</p>

<p>
With a proper understanding of God's divine nature&#x2013;to the extent that we can
understand it&#x2013; and an understanding of the relationship between this divine
nature and the human nature (or the angelic nature, for that matter), it becomes
impossible to think of any created being as an entity on par with, much less
greater than God. Thus, it becomes impossible to venerate a created being in any
way that rivals our veneration and worship of God.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Catholics do not worship anyone or anything apart from God. In
Catholicism, <i>worship</i> requires sacrifice, and the highest sacrifice is the very
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ (the Eucharist). Thus, the Catholic Mass (or
Orthodox Divine Liturgies) are the ultimate Sacrifice of God to God. Orthodox or
apostolic Christians&#x2013;including Catholics&#x2013;offer the Mass to no one other than
God. St. Mary is <b>not</b> worthy of the Sacrifice of the Mass. Thus, we worship God
alone.
</p>

<p>
In Catholic teaching, we give only God the fullest honor and worship. This is
called latria, the supreme worship allowed to God alone. After God the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we allow ourselves to <i>reverence</i> other created
beings. Thing of this as honor, such as is due a king or a ruler or some other
dignitary. Such honor is referred to as dulia, and this encapsulates reverence
that we show to St. Mary, the angels, and the saints. In fact, Catholics
recognize St. Mary as the pinnacle of the created order, and we give her not
latria, but an extreme form of dulia, called hyperdulia.

<h3 id="orgfcef16a"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> The Teachings and Traditions of the Catholic Church Cannot be Trusted</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfcef16a">
<p>
The burden of proof is on him or her who claims this. They must show which false
teachings were invented by the Catholic Church, and when.
</p>

<p>
This is a problem for <i>sola scriptura</i> Christians. If the teachings and the
traditions of the Catholic Church are unreliable, then how can they be sure of
the Bible? The list of books included in the Bible was established by
tradition. Notably, the Canon 24 of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3816.htm">Council of Carthage (419 AD)</a> list the
books of the Bible, stating that only these books are to be considered as
Canonical Scripture, and that only these books are to be read in church. This
list was preserved under the oral tradition of the Church: "besides the
Canonical Scriptures nothing be read in church under the name of divine
Scripture.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But the Canonical Scriptures are as follows: &#x2026; for these are the things which 
we have received from our fathers to be read in church."
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This is an interesting argument. It goes like this: the Catholic Church cannot
be trusted because its teachings are corrupted in that they look very different
from what we read in the Bible.
</p>

<p>
The burden of proof is on the person who would say that the teachings of the
Catholic Church are corrput. Which teachings are corrupt?
</p>

<p>
The Catholic Church actually has the receipts. Here are some teachings often
objected to by some Protestants that go way back to the beginning:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist (the elements of Communion
really are the Body and Blood of Jesus). This teaching was recorded in
graphic detail in John 6 by John the Evangelist, and supported in the other
Gospels and in 1 Corinthians 11 by discussions of Christ affirming the Real
Presence. One of John's students, Ignatius of Antioch, wrote in affirmation
of the Real Presence before his death in 110 AD, within about two decades of
John the Evangelist's death and his authorship of the book of the
Revelation. Justin Martyr and numerous Church fathers affirmed the Real
Presence through the centuries, and even Martin Luther affirmed the Real
Presence. One of Martin Luther's contemporaries, Ulrich Zwingli, first
introduced a symbolist interpretation of Communion in about 1523. The Real
Presence has been the teaching in Christianity from the beginning, and a
symbolist interpretation is the historical and dogmatic novelty that is not
even held uniformly among Protestants.</li>
<li>The veneration of Mary. The Church's great regard for Mary goes back to the
beginning. Luke 1:28 records a very unique angelic greeting to Mary. The
archangel Gabriel even tells her that she has found favor with God, and that
she is graced completely and enduringly. St. Justin Martyr (around 100-165
AD) recognizes Mary as the new Eve, and St. Iranaeus of Lyon further
developed this theme. Tertullian (155-240 AD) discussed Mary's perpetual
virginity. St. Athanasius (around 296-373 AD) called her noble and great with an unsurpassed
greatness.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These doctrines were present at the start and our understanding of them
developed hundreds of years before the Church first identified a closed set of
books to be called the Bible.

<p>
The practice of confession—also known as the Sacrament of Penance or
Reconciliation—has undergone several significant changes throughout the
history of the Catholic Church. Here's a broad historical overview:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Early Church (1st–3rd centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Public Confession</b>: Serious sins (apostasy, murder, adultery) were
confessed <b><b>publicly</b></b> before the Christian community.</li>
<li><b>Once-in-a-lifetime Penance</b>: Penance was <b>long and harsh</b>, often lasting
months or years, and usually allowed <b>only once</b> after Baptism.</li>
<li><b>Reconciliation</b>: After completing the penance, the sinner was formally
reconciled by the bishop, often during Holy Week.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post-Constantinian Era (4th–6th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As Christianity gained legal status, <b><b>public penance</b></b> continued but
began to soften in practice.</li>
<li>The <b>bishop</b> played a key role in reconciliation.</li>
<li><b>Private spiritual direction</b> emerged, but public confession remained
standard for grave sins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Influence (6th–9th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Monastic practice in Ireland and Britain introduced <b>private
confession</b> to a priest or abbot.</li>
<li><b>Frequent confession*</b> became more common.</li>
<li>Penances were assigned using <b>penitential books</b> listing sins and
appropriate penances.</li>
<li>This model spread to continental Europe through missionaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medieval Period (9th–13th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>Fourth Lateran Council (1215)</b> mandated <b><b>annual confession</b></b> for all Catholics (the "Easter Duty").</li>
<li>Confession became <b><b>private, auricular</b></b>, and often <b><b>anonymous</b></b>.</li>
<li>The <b>seal of confession</b> (absolute secrecy) was firmly established.</li>
<li>Emphasis on the <b>three acts of the penitent</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Contrition</li>
<li>Confession</li>
<li>Satisfaction</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Council of Trent &amp; Counter-Reformation (1545–1563)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reaffirmed the necessity of <b>confession to a priest</b> for forgiveness of
mortal sins.</li>
<li>Stressed <b><b>sacramental grace</b></b> and the priest’s role in <b>absolution</b>.</li>
<li>Promoted regular, devout confession as part of Catholic life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern Period (19th–20th centuries)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Popes like <b>Pius X</b> encouraged <b>frequent confession</b> and <b>frequent Communion</b>.</li>
<li><b>Confessionals</b> became standard in churches for privacy.</li>
<li>Catechesis began to emphasize a <b>personal relationship with God</b> and
<b>interior conversion</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post-Vatican II Era (1960s–present)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Vatican II</b> highlighted the <b>communal and healing</b> aspects of the
sacrament.</li>
<li>Introduced <b>three forms</b> of the <b>Rite of Penance</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Individual confession and absolution (ordinary form).</li>
<li>Communal celebration with individual confession and absolution.</li>
<li>General absolution in emergencies (e.g., war, disaster).</li>
<li><b>Decline in regular practice</b> observed in many areas, though
<b>renewals</b> occur seasonally and in youth movements.</li>

<b>A Celibate Priesthood</b>
One argument against the validity of the is suggests that the Catholic Church
mandates celibacy for its priesthood, and this is contrary to the Scriptural
allowances for church leaders to be married and have children. We can borrow
text stating this argument:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1 Timothy 3:1-13 and Titus 1:6-9, the Apostle Paul seems to assume that
elders, bishops, overseers, and deacons will be married. Notice the phrases
“the husband of one wife” (1 Timothy 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6), “he must manage his
own family well” (1 Timothy 3:4,12), and “his children obey him with proper
respect” (1 Timothy 3:4; Titus 1:6). On a related issue, please read our
article on whether these Scripture mean that a church leader must be married
and have children. While these Scriptures are not a requirement for church
leaders to be married, they most definitely present an allowance for church
leaders to be married. It is therefore anti-biblical for any church to
require celibacy of its leaders. 
</p>

<p>
Why, then, does the Roman Catholic Church (and a few other Christian
denominations) require celibacy of priests/church leaders? (<i>source:
<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/celibacy-priests.html">gotquestions.org</a></i>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two fallacies in the above quote, which we may readily point out:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The Catholic Church actually allows does not require celibacy of all
priests. For example, priests within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches">Eastern Rite</a> may be married,
which is similar to Orthodox or Oriental churches outside of the Catholic
Church. Think of a rite as something similar to a Protestant
denomination. A rite upholds the authority of the Pope as well as Catholic 
dogmas, but it may vary in terms of disciplines, such as whether priests
may be married, or which form of the Mass is used. The Latin Rite (also
known as the Roman Rite) is the most well-known rite in America, and
indeed, Canon 277 in <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib2-cann208-329_en.html#CHAPTER_III.">Book II, Title III, Chapter III</a> of the Code of Canon
Law governing the Roman rite calls 
for celibacy among clerics: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the
sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is
a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to
Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more
freely to the service of God and humanity. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even within the Roman Rite, there are exceptions. The Pastoral Provision
of 1980 by Pope St. John Paul II allows for former non-Catholic priests
who convert to Catholicism to become priests, even if previously married
with children.
</p></li>

<li>There is no Scriptural prohibition preventing the Catholic Church from
exercising its authority requiring celibacy for its clerics in most
cases. Clerical celibacy mirors Christ's full dedication to the Church.</li>

<b>What Catholic Teachings and Practices Can Change Over Time?</b>
</p>
<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>

<p>
We find it helpful to borrow and insert an excerpt from David Currie's book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Fundamentalist-Again-Catholic/dp/089870569X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=N6DKLQ0CZQTV&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vDX3wDEgULuN8bgk8-pDtJaFRGshOT8g26SOSPOvjBmkArH1D-Zi_AyPp9cHH9EQ3rdoCrcPV7SljGS6TuNiVmGmHYm1EYaN29p4XFuCIXUtyyEa-etTcfCdPqFkQepI.mzbqSSA2JLUd9uzJquDieZCGhLfgkDJHtfTAryaPI8E&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=born+fundamentalist+born+again+catholic+by+david+currie&amp;qid=1746584011&amp;sprefix=David+Currie+Born%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-1">Born Evangelical, Born Again Catholic</a>. Here, Currie addresses the question of
<b>changing doctrines</b> in the Catholic church. Currie helpfully distinguishes
between types of doctrinal changes, and he categorizes Catholic teachings and
practices into five categores, which we abbreviate as <i>Deposit</i>, <i>Dogma</i>,
<i>Doctrine</i>, <i>Discipline</i>, and <i>Devotion</i>. I can do no better than to let Currie
speak for himself here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Change has occurred and will continue to occur. This was an important issue to
me because I felt that no organization could be the true church if it
contradicted itself on essential doctrines over time. I spent quite a bit of 
time thinking this over. Here are my observations.
</p>

<p>
Since change is a very general term, let us separate it into two parts. There is
a change that expands on prior truths without negating them, which I will call
“development”. This type of change “unpacks” meaning inherent in the original
truth so that the truth can be understood better. It defines. The other type of
change reverses that which has been accepted originally. I will call that type
“contradiction”. Contradiction affirms one day that “A” is true, and the next
insists that “non-A” is true.
</p>

<p>
There is one other distinction we must make. In thinking through this issue for
my own edification, I came to see that the information of the church could be
divided into at least five categories: deposit, dogma, doctrine, discipline, and
devotion. I devised these categories for my own thinking, so I suppose the
alliteration proves that I once studied homiletics. These are not the categories
of the church herself, but merely distinctions that helped me clarify the idea
of change.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deposit</b> is that body of truth originally given to the apostles. In time, some of
it was written into Scripture, while some of it remained in its original form of
oral tradition. Protecting this deposit is a major responsibility of the
bishops. The church teaches that nothing can be added to or contradicted within
the deposit. For example, Peter had no authority to make up a new story about
Jesus healing someone. General revelation ended with the death of John, the last
apostle. The goal regarding the deposit is simply to conserve it with no change
whatsoever. As an evangelical, I was surprised at how seriously Catholics
regarded this responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dogma</b> is that body of truth that has been affirmed by the councils of the
church and the Holy See of Rome. The further explanation, definition, and
development of the concepts within the deposit, as well as the deposit itself,
are contained within dogma. Once dogma is declared by the bishops, it can be
further developed but never contradicted by future doctrine or dogma. I could
find no case within Vatican II where earlier dogma was contradicted. Dogma is
usually declared in Council or by the Pope to combat a particular problem. For
example, the dogma regarding the divinity of Christ was not declared by counsel
until teachers in the early church questioned that truth of the deposit. The
deposit always contained the truths of Christ’s divinity, however. The Council
of Nicaea certainly did not invent new truth about Christ’s nature as
God-man. They merely clarified the truth already believed. So, dogma can be
developed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Doctrine</b> is the development of truth on the basis of the deposit and
dogma. Doctrine can develop and even contradict itself over time because it is
largely the thoughts of people. It has not been officially declared true or
false by the church. This is the realm in which most theologians deal, on the
cutting edge of the Church’s thinking. One Catholic theologian may totally
contradict another equally Catholic theologian. They both can’t be right, yet
the church is withholding her judgment on that particular issue. More thought,
more wisdom, or more time may be needed before the church decides which
formulation of that particular doctrine is fully consistent with the deposit and
dogma. Doctrine pushes the envelope of the Church as far and is only slowly if
ever, accepted as dogma.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise good, careful evangelical scholars make the mistake of taking doctrine
as the unchangeable teaching of the Church. When they see it changing over time,
they draw the wrong conclusions. The reason is relatively simple. The ultimate
authority in most evangelical churches of what is truly biblical rests with
those men teaching at the seminary from which that church draws its pastors. If
the pastor and board get into a theological tussle over some issue, it is not
unusual for a seminary professor to be called in to moderate and to decide the
truth in question. As a result, when these same evangelical scholars attempt to
understand what is really going on inside the Catholic Church, they make the
mistake of looking to their counterparts in the Catholic seminaries as the
authorities on Catholic theology. 
</p>

<p>
It seems that every evangelical pastor has at least one anti-Catholic book in
his study. When I informed my pastor of my intentions, he lent me a book written
by a professor at TEDS who is now at another institution. This truly fine
scholar stumbled rather dramatically in his research because he made precisely
the mistake of considering professors as the authorities. In the Catholic Church
the professor is not the final arbiter of truth; the bishops and the Pope
are. The church’s pronouncements are very accessible, but most evangelicals
don’t ever read these documents, much less footnote the, in their discussions of
what Catholics teach. You do not know what Catholics teach unless you go to the
sources that they themselves accept as authoritative. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Disciplines</b> are those rules that govern the everyday life of faithful
Catholics. This area has seen the most change (contradiction) in our generation,
and it is this very visible area that people usually point to when they accuse
the church of having changed since Vatican II. For example, in the past,
Catholics were required to fast on the Ember Days, 12 days each year. They are
no longer required to do this.
</p>

<p>
This is a bitter pill for evangelicals to swallow, but disciplines are supposed
to be mandatory once in force, yet some of them may be changed over time. It
would have been wrong for a Catholic to ignore the Ember Days fast in the
1950s. Yet now it is no longer necessary to fast on the former Ember Days
(except Good Friday) because this discipline has been rescinded. Why?  It has to
do with obedience.
</p>

<p>
As Christians, we are under the authority of the apostles’ successors, the
bishops. They are responsible for making rules that will enhance the spiritual
life of their flock. Although that goal never changes, the rules of discipline
may. When the bishops decide an existing rule is no longer effective in helping
people worship God, or when they determine that a new rule would be effective,
it is a Catholics duty to obey them. This is certainly in line with the promise:
“Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth will be loosed in heaven.” Disciplines by their very nature are going to
be developed and contradicted over time — bound when the need arises and loosed
when appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<b>Devotions</b> are the most personal of these five categories. Devotions are those 
activities by which an individual Christian may enhance his walk with God. The
Catholic use of “devotion” is much broader than the evangelical use of the
word. It means much more than Bible study and prayer. Devotions are never
mandatory for a Catholic layman, although they may be approved and are highly
recommended. History illustrates that devotions develop over time. One
well-known example of a devotion is the Rosary. I remember being relieved to
learn that a practicing Catholic could choose never to say the Rosary and still
be a good Catholic. A priest friend helped me understand that Christ and his
sacrificial death are at the very center of Catholic worship. The Rosary is only
about eight centuries old. Most Catholics, however, wonder why anyone would
choose not to speak with Mary. As a devotion, the Rosary is approved by the
church, but it is never mandated. Devotions can develop.

<p>
Some critics of the Catholic Church claim that it is an organization that looks
unlike the early church of the Bible. It is a behemoth of an organization with
a structure not described in the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
This criticism suffers from many flaws:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Underlying this claim is another claim: that all valid Christian practices
and beliefs must be explicitly found in the Bible. The great irony here is
that this claim does not pass its own test: it is found nowhere in the Bible
that a belief or practice must be found in the Bible.</li>
<li>The seed of the present-day ecclesial structure <b>is</b> in fact found in the
Bible. See the discussion box below for more details.</li>

<b>Scriptural Origins of Ecclesial Structure</b>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Read more ...</summary>

<p>
The modern Catholic ecclesial structure—composed primarily of <b>bishops</b>,
<b>priests</b>, and <b>deacons</b> —-has both Scriptural roots and historical
development. The New Testament lays the foundation for this threefold
ministry, which the Catholic Church understands as being instituted by Christ
and developed under the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the early Church. 
</p>

<p>
Below is a breakdown of Scriptural support for each of these offices:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Bishops</b> (Greek: ἐπίσκοπος – episkopos, "overseer")
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scriptural references
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acts 1:20 – Peter interprets Psalm 109:8 to establish a replacement for
Judas: “His office let another take.” The Greek word used is episkopē.</li>
<li><p>
Acts 20:28 – Paul tells the elders of Ephesus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the Holy
Spirit has made you overseers (episkopoi), to shepherd the church of
God.” 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
1 Timothy 3:1–7 – Paul describes the qualities of a bishop/overseer
(episkopos):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><b>Early Church understanding</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The terms presbyter (elder) and episkopos (overseer) were used somewhat
interchangeably early on, but by the 2nd century (cf. St. Ignatius of
Antioch, still very early in the second century), a clearer distinction
was made between bishops and presbyters (priests).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Priests</b> (Greek: πρεσβύτερος – <i>presbyteros</i>, "elder")
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scriptural References:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Acts 14:23 – Paul and Barnabas appoint elders (presbyteroi) in each
church:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“And when they had appointed elders for them in every church&#x2026;”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
1 Timothy 5:17 –
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,
especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
James 5:14 –
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord.”
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note: The term <i>presbyteros</i> evolved into the English word “priest”,
particularly as it passed through Latin (presbyter). In Catholic
theology, presbyters share in the bishop’s priesthood and are primarily
responsible for the sacraments and preaching in local communities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Deacons</b> (Greek: διάκονος – diakonos, "servant" or "minister")
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scriptural References:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acts 6:1–6 – Seven men (including Stephen and Philip) are appointed to
serve tables so the apostles can focus on prayer and the Word. While
not called "deacons" here, this is traditionally seen as the origin of
the diaconate.</li>
<li><p>
Philippians 1:1 – Paul addresses:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the
bishops (episkopoi) and deacons (diakonoi).” 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>1 Timothy 3:8–13 – Paul gives qualifications for deacons, showing it as
a distinct and recognized office.</li>

<h2 id="mary">Saint Mary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-mary">
<p>
Saint Mary is regarded by Catholics as the pinnacle of Creation. We give her the
highest possible devotion without considering it worship. This is because while
God&#x2013;in the Three Persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&#x2013;is the eternal,
infinite, immaterial, and uncreated Creator. Mary, however dignified, is part of the Creator's creation:
like the rest of creation, she has a beginning, and she is finite. However, she
plays a unique role in the cosmic drama of salvation, for the immaterial,
eternal, and unchanging Son received His temporal, material, and changing human
body from Mary through the work of the Holy Spirit. By her obedience and
subservience to God, she became a portal of the Divine. God has approached us
indeed, and He has done so in Jesus Christ through Mary, His mother.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I have a love and admire Mary for three principal reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>She is an instigator of grace</li>
<li>She is an intercessor</li>
<li>She is an example</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org076896f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org076896f">Mary as an Instigator of Grace</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org076896f">

<div id="org2d6be2d" class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.wga.hu/detail/a/angelico/09/corridor/annunci.jpg" alt="annunci.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 11: </span>The Annunciation is an important event in salvation history. St. Gabriel presented God's will to St. Mary, and she accepted this. This event marks the Incarnation of Christ, and it is celebrated in the Catholic Church nine months prior to Christmas, annually on March 25.</p>
</div>

<p>
Catholics look to St. Mary as an important instigator of grace; but, she is not
the originator of grace. God, of course, is the source of all graces. However,
St. Mary plays a special role in salvation history. First and foremost, St. Mary
embraced God's will when it was presented to her by the archangel,
St. Gabriel. In response to her <i>fiat</i>, she conceived by the Holy Spirit, and
received the Son of God into her body, providing Christ with His body through her biology and the
work of the Holy Spirit. Her cooperation with God's will thus enabled the
Incarnation of Christ. Through St. Mary, the unchanging and eternal Son of God
entered into time and space as Jesus Christ, the source of all graces together
with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Thus, since St. Mary is the portal of
God the Son into His creation, and the Son brings us all graces, St. Mary has
been called the "portal of grace" or the "gate of heaven."
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, it should be noted that St. Mary is not the ultimate cause of our
graces. Rather, God, in His generosity created humanity and willed St. Mary to 
exist. Furthermore, in His grace and generosity, He invited her to participate
in His plan of salvation for mankind by accepting the role chosen for her. Her
willing cooperation with God's will and invitation, then, led to Christ's life,
death and resurrection.
</p>

<p>
For St. Mary's supporting and enabling role in humanity's redemption through
Christ, St. Mary is known as the <b>New Eve</b>. This is because her role is the
antithesis of Eve's role in Adam's sin and the Fall. This is described in more
detail below.

the Bible&#x2013;indeed, before the notion of the Bible even existed&#x2013;the early Church
fathers recognized a stunning parallel between Eve and Mary. Let us tabulate

<p>
Mary is called the <b>New Eve</b> because her faithful obedience to God's will
reversed the disobedience of Eve. Where Eve’s disobedience led to the Fall and
death, Mary’s obedience opened the way for the Incarnation and the gift of
eternal life through Jesus Christ, the New Adam (cf. Romans 5:12–21; 1
Corinthians 15:22, 45). 
</p>

<p>
Eve is seen as the "mother of all the living" (Genesis 3:20), but her action
brought spiritual death into the world. Mary, through her "yes" to God at the
Annunciation (Luke 1:38), becomes the spiritual mother of all the redeemed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Who first made this observation?</b>
</p>

<p>
The typology of Mary as the New Eve appears very early in Christian theology:

<p>
<b>"The knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary."</b>  
— <b>St. Irenaeus</b>, <b>Against Heresies</b> 3.22.4  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>When did this occur relative to the canon of Scripture?</b>
</p>

<p>
The New Eve typology was articulated decades <b>before</b> the biblical canon was finalized:
</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
So the New Eve theology <b>predates</b> the Church's formal listing of the biblical canon by over 200 years.
</p>

<p>
<b>Would this concept have been known to the bishops who determined the canon?</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes. The Eve–Mary typology was already <b>well established</b> in orthodox Christian
teaching by the time the canon was finalized. Bishops and theologians at the
Councils of Hippo and Carthage would likely have been familiar with:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The teachings of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus</li>
<li>The biblical typology between Eve and Mary (Genesis–Luke connection)</li>
<li>The importance of Mary’s obedience as part of salvation history</li>
</ul>

<p>
This typology supported a <b>unified understanding</b> of Scripture and Tradition in
the early Church.
</p>

<p>
<b>The relationship between the Marian typology and the canon of the Scriptures</b> is
important because it <b>undermines</b> the claim made by many that Catholic
veneration of Mary is unscriptural. It is certainly <b>not</b> unscriptural or
antiscriptural, since the councils of bishops who were identifying which books
to call Scripture would have been aware of Marian typology, and they would never
have called Scripture books that undermine this.

Additionally, the wedding at Cana gives us a second picture of St. Mary as an
instigator of grace. She recognized the problematic situation, and she brought
it to the attention of Jesus Christ, her Son. He expressed that it was not His
will to resolve the situation at that time. Nonetheless, at her propmting and
instruction to do whatever He tells them, the people involved approached
Christ. He then acted, performing His first public miracle, commencing His
ministry in a public way.

Catholics are pro-life because God is pro-life. Divine revelation tells us that
the <i>imago dei</i> (image of God) is stamped on every human being. This means that
each person has infinite dignity. Furthermore, we believe that the shedding of
innocent blood is <i>always</i> wrong. There is no more innocent person than a baby,
especially a baby in the womb who has not done any wrong. Therefore, babies in
the womb are the most innocent among us, and they are the most vulnerable. To
kill these defenseless people is always wrong.

Some concerns arise over the mental health of a mother of a baby conceived
through sexual assault. Proponents of a rape/incest exemption for abortion
suggest that to bear and raise the child will be a constant reminder to the
mother of her abuse. Nonetheless, assault survivors sometimes choose life for
their babies, and they can and do find great healing. The inseparable bond
between mother and baby in fact can bring great healing to a suvivor of sexual
assault or abuse. This video interview features Jennifer Christie is a rape survivor who chose
life for her son.

<p>
Abortion leads to other health concerns, both mental and physical. First,
abortion always is traumatic. A mother is placed in an unnatural position&#x2013;under
emotional duress&#x2013;of choosing between life and death for her baby. My own
personal friends who work in the pro-life space have said that survivors of
sexual abuse and assault who choose to kill their baby never get over it: they
have killed their own baby, and it's a choice that cannot be undone.
</p>

<p>
Health concerns also arise. Namely, there is a link between abortion and breast
cancer. For example, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16526417/">review article</a> by Kitchen, Rivedi, and Mokbel points to a
link, and the abstract to their article reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The hormonal changes that take place in pregnancy cause breast tissue to
proliferate and differentiate. Abortion interrupts this process and may leave
the proliferated, undifferentiated breast tissue at higher risk of
carcinogenesis. This review explains the supposed difference in effects of
induced and spontaneous abortion upon the breast tissue and examines the
literature for a link with breast cancer. Additional subcategories examined
include parity, number of abortions, gestation, and maternal age at abortion. A
comparison of retrospective and prospective studies is made and possible sources
of bias are identified. There is no evidence to support a link between
spontaneous abortion and breast cancer. Absence of a link with induced abortion
is less clear, and further research should concentrate on investigating any
relationship. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nonetheless, the American Cancer Society (ACS) claims that
<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html">there is no link between abortion and breast cancer</a>. Could this be true, or
could it be possible that abortion is so profitable that some stakeholders would
seek to suppress information about the link between abortion and breast cancer
and manipulate the narrative propagated by the US Government and the mainstream
media?

In May 2018, Irish voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to repeal the
Eighth Amendment, which effectively banned abortion in Ireland except in cases
where the mother's life was at risk. The amendment was introduced in 1983 and
had been a significant point of contention for decades. The 2018 referendum
passed with 66.4% of voters in favor, leading to the legalization of abortion
during the first trimester of pregnancy.   
</p>

<p>
But manipulation by big tech may have played a role here. Leading up to the
referrendum vote in 2018, Google banned <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44055077">Google banned abortion poll adds</a> in
Ireland. Proponents of the Eighth Ammendment claim that the ban favored
pro-abortion groups and disproportionately hurt the pro-life cause (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44067607">link</a>),
eventually leading the Eight Ammendment to be overturned. This led to widespread
abortion access in Ireland, and a new market for the abortion industry.
</p>

<p>
But, Big Tech fair and balanced, right? They would never try to suppress
information, nor manipulate the masses, nor influence a vote, right?
&#x2026; Right?!?

<p>
One heroic mother is St. Gianna Beretta Molla. She was diagnosed with a uterine
tumor while pregnant with her fourth child. A <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint/gianna-beretta-molla-741">Catholic News Agency article</a>
reads,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The doctors gave her three choices: an abortion, which would save her life and
allow her to have more children but take the life of her baby; a complete
hysterectomy, which would save her life but prevent her from having more
children and take her baby’s life; or removal of the fibroma only, which posed
the risk of future complications but could save the life of her baby. 
</p>

<p>
Gianna chose to have only the tumor removed. She was willing to lose her life
for the sake of her baby’s. She knew that she may not make it through delivery,
but she made it very clear that if a choice needed to be made between saving her
own life or the child’s, the child needed to be saved. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout her pregnancy, Gianna found strength in the Lord and asked him to
take any pain away from the child. 
</p>

<p>
On April 21, 1962 Gianna Emmanuel Molla was successfully delivered by Cesarean
section. However, after complications arose with the tumor, Gianna passed away 7
days later on April 28. 
</p>

<p>
Gianna was beatified by Saint Pope John Paul II on April 24, 1994 and canonized
as a saint on May 16, 2004. Her husband and children attended her canonization.

Other valiant, heroic, and saintly mothers have made similar choices. We covet
their prayers!

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-prolife-double-effect">
<p>
The principle of double effect allows actions that cause harm as a side effect,
provided the harm is not intended, and the overall action is morally
permissible. "The ends justify the means" suggests that any means, even immoral
ones, are justifiable if they lead to a desirable outcome. The key difference
lies in the intention behind the harmful effect. The principle of double effect
only permits harm if it's not intended, while "the ends justify the means"
justifies any means, regardless of intent.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Principle of Double Effect
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focus: This principle focuses on the intended and unintended consequences of
actions.</li>
<li>Permissibility: It states that an action is permissible even if it causes a

<li>Conditions:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For the principle to apply, the following conditions must be met:

<li>The evil effect must not be intended, but merely foreseen.</li>

<h4 id="org9101f57">Birth Control, Abortion, and the Sexual Revolution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9101f57">
<p>
The decadence and permissivity of today's sexually-permissive culture can be
traced to the sexual revolution of the 1960s. The sexual revolution can be
traced back to birth control and practices contrary to natural law.
</p>

<p>
The Catholic Church uses natural law in addition to tradition and scripture to
determine morality. Indeed, the morality of various sexual acts can be derived
from natural law.
</p>

<p>
Natural law is a body of unchanging moral principles regarded as a basis for all
human conduct. When applied to the marital act, natural law looks to the
function and design of the human body. The marital act is known to have a
two-fold purpose: a <b>reproductive</b> function, in which the human race is
propagated; and a <b>unitive</b> function, in which a husband and wife form and express
an intimate bond that is ordered toward love for one another and children that
come from this union.  Since these two functions are part of the marital act,
any practice that seeks to subvert, suppress, or defeat one function is illicit
and immoral according to natural law.
</p>

<p>
For example, contraceptive acts that seek to suppress the reproductive aspect
leave make the marital act all about pleasure. In this case, the partners tend
to use one another for pleasure and seek to avoid the potential for parental
responsibilities that come with the possibility of children conceived during the
act. Additionally, other acts that cannot produce new life but involve sexual
intimacy are illicit and immoral according to natural law, such as
self-pleasure and same-sex intimate relations. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, acts that focus on reproduction without spousal intimacy
(think <i>in vitro</i> fertalization, surrogate motherhood, etc.) also are immoral
and illicit per natural law. In these cases, children are brought into the
world apart from a natural and intimate relationship between a mother and
father. Every child has a right to a mother and a father, and such artificial
acts deprive the child of one or both of these rights.
</p>

<p>
Notably, the 1968 papal encyclical <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html"><i>Humanae Vitae</i></a>, Pope Paul VI predicted that
the widespread use of contraception would lead to negative consequences,
including a decline in moral standards, marital infidelity, and a loss of
respect for women. For more information on this, see also:

If you feel God's prompting to explore Catholicism, or if you simply want to
learn more, you have several options.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Adults may enroll in the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults
(OCIA). Typically free of charge, this entails several months of classroom
instruction and, if you wish, it will culminate in the three sacraments of
Christian initiation: baptism, confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist. This is
focused on orienting an individual toward a lifelong journey of discipleship
and service to Christ.
</p>

<p>
Typically, OCIA courses commence in the fall (around August or September) and
conclude with batpisms, confirmations, and first communion around Easter.
</p>

<p>
Local to the Waco area are offerings by several Catholic parishes or centers:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://baylorcatholic.org">St. Peter's Catholic Student Center</a> at the edge of Baylor's campus caters
heavily to Baylor's students. Faculty, staff, and friends of the
university also participate at St. Peter's. The OCIA courses at
St. Peter's are called the <a href="https://baylorcatholic.org/catholicism-1">Basic Teachings</a>, and typically take place on Monday
nights.</li>
<li><a href="https://stlouiswaco.com">St. Louis Catholic Church</a> is a family-friendly parish that also runs the
only Catholic school in Waco. St. Louis is a thriving parish, with over
1000 families represented. In 2024, St. Louis grew from about 1300
families to over 1900 families. You may <a href="https://stlouiswaco.com/rcia">sign up</a> for the St. Louis OCIA
program.</li>
<li><a href="https://stjosephwaco.com">St. Joseph Catholic Church</a> is located close to the Baylor Campus. Less
student-centric and more family-oriented, St. Jospeh also offers <a href="https://stjosephwaco.com/ocia">OCIA</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are also several other parishes in the Waco area that offer OCIA.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If you are so excited and so moved that you don't want to wait for OCIA
(you'll eventually have to take it, unless you are exceptionally prepared; an
interview with a priest may reveal that you are ready to be initiated right
away).
</p>

<p>
You can begin learning on your own. Fr. John Riccardo is a great catechist
and evangelist, and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2oBIjKcCFUI03M67Wk14mfqN4fTFVfkE">YouTube playlist</a> has a full set of OCIA courses for
his parish. <i>Note: when these videos were created, OCIA was called the Rite
of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA)</i>.

field live phone calls on a broad range of topics. The host, Cy Kellet, takes
phone calls, and various apologists and speakers answer according to their
expertise. You can see the <a href="https://www.catholic.com/audio/cal">radio show schedule</a>, complete with a list of topics
and guests, so you can call in on a particular day.
</p>

<p>
Recurring guests include several apologists, including
Protestants-turned-Catholic, such as Tim Staples (former Assemblies of God
minister) and Jimmy Akin. Others include Dr. Karlo Broussard and Trent Horn.
</p>

<p>
Here is a sample episode by Dr. Karlo Broussard, entitled <i>What Catholic Doctrine
Troubles You Most?</i>

<p>
The <a href="https://chnetwork.org/converts/">Coming Home Network</a> was established to help non-Catholic Christians, clergy
and laity, discover the truth and beauty of Catholicism and to make the journey
home to the Catholic Church. This site has numerous <a href="https://chnetwork.org/converts/">conversion stories</a> (<a href="https://chnetwork.org/category/all-stories/">full
archive)</a> of people from various backgrounds who converted to Catholicisim. A
number of Evangelical Protestants, pastors, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, and more.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here is the story of Eddie Trask, who, like me, is a Catholic who
lived as an Evangelical Protestant and then came back to Catholicism.

as a gift from Pope St. John Paul II to the world in terms of human
dignity. This talk discusses how erotic love was designed by God to propel us
toward God.

On Jun 18, 2025, as the Israel-Iran conflict was heating up, Tony called
Dr. David Anders about the modern state of Israel and God's blessing. Father Dan 
Rehill made an appearance on the Sean Ryan Show (<a href="https://youtu.be/0svd0YPi-9I?si=Vp4QpVHZZSPv24yn&amp;t=8069">Episode 141</a>), and he seemed to
teach that anyone who messes with Israel will be frustrated by the hand of
God. Dr. Anders addresses this belief: Israel does not get a free pass to commit
genocide and atrocity. The prophecies of blessing are not fulfilled in Israel,
but rather in the Person of Jesus Christ. Rather, God seeks that His people life
justly. <i>My own observation: God punished His people quite harshly in the Old
Testament for their own idolatry, sin, and injustice. Those who claim to be
God's people need to be sure they are on the side of justice, love, and mercy.</i>
Dr. Anders also highlights <a href="https://www.kairospalestine.ps">Kairos Palestine</a>, an eccumenical Christian
organization that advocates for the end to Israeli acts of opression and
injustice committed against Palestinian Christians.

<div id="outline-container-orgd078b3f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd078b3f">John 1 (2025.06.20)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd078b3f">
<p>
This is an intense chapter, so full and so rich. Major themes that strike me today:
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="orgb6ba1db"></a>God has drawn near to us<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb6ba1db">
<p>
This passage tells us how God, in His generosity, has drawn near to us. It tells
us where He came from: from eternity past. He didn't have to create the
universe, and He didn't have to create us.
</p>

<p>
Some have said that He needed to create us, because God is Love; and, Love needs
an object to be fully expressed. Yet, this is a mistaken notion for a few
reasons. First, God had perfect love since eternity past in the perfect
communion of the Trinity. Second, God does not need anything, since He is
self-sustaining and not lacking in anything, since He is the source of all
things.
</p>

<p>
Why did He create us despite knowing how it would all unfold? Out of His
generosity. And, despite our sin and rebellion, He came to us (verse 1:14) in
the flesh. How great a mystery is this that the eternal, immaterial, and
unchanging Son&#x2013;the Creator&#x2013;would integrate with His creation by taking on a
finite, physical, and temporal human body, vulnerable and helpless
as a baby?!? And why did He do this? So that He could draw near to us and draw
us near to Himsel! And in His nearness to us, He brings us life (for He is the
source of life itself) and light for He is the source of all existence and
reality, and truth is the revelation of reality.
</p>

<p>
The picture of a cosmic approach of God to humanity becomes even more personal
as we are told of Christ approaching John the Baptist.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org6e30e34"></a>God draws men near to Himself<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6e30e34">
<p>
In verse 36, we begin to see Jesus draw men to know Him and to follow Him.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgd4ac911"></a>The Mystery of the Incarnation<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd4ac911">
<p>
In chapter 1, we see a great mystery: the Creator, the Word, the author of Life,
is disguised, hidden, and unseen; yet, He is present in human form as an
ordinary man. To see the God in this Man takes an act of faith and a willingness
to look at what appears normal; or maybe, since I have read this Gospel many
times, a willingness to look at what I have seen before and be open to learning
more. Nathaniel heard of Jesus and wondered if anything worthwhile could come
from Nazareth. Nonetheless, after talking to Jesus, he was willing to say, "You
are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel."
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgb44fd88"></a>The Baptism<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb44fd88">
<p>
Christ is Himself baptized by John the Baptist. We now have the testimony of
John the Baptist for Jesus as being the Son of God; and we have the sign from
the Holy Spirit, signifying and confirming this.
</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1cf4c2b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1cf4c2b">John 2 (2025.06.21)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1cf4c2b">
<p>
This chapter opens with a marriage at Cana, where the mother of Jesus
was. Interestingly, it states that "Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with
his disciples."
</p>

<p>
I see here Mary, the mother of Jesus, as an instigator of grace. She presented
Jesus with the predicament faced by the wedding celebrants: "They have no wine."
</p>

<p>
Christ's response was "My hour has not yet come," indicating that it was not His
will to do anything about it. It was not His will to initiate His
public ministry. Yet, Mary, His mother, goads Him on. In her faithful way,
commends the servants to Jesus, pointing them to Him and telling them, "<b>Do
whatever He tells you</b>." She has this way of bringing the needy to the Provider,
and instigating a move by the Provider. While this may appear strange to
Protestant eyes because they are not accustomed to thinking of Mary as an
instigator of grace, we also can recognize this in the conception (type) of Mary
as the New Eve. Just as Eve was called "woman" in Genesis, Jesus&#x2013;through
John&#x2013;highlights the connection between Mary and Eve as He calls her "woman."
This is an honorable reference, not a denigrating treatment of His mother, as we
modern-day Americans could understand this. For us Catholics, this can encourage
us to <b>involve Our Mother as a prayer partner and intercessor</b>, and yet to <b>fully
trust and obey Jesus</b>.
</p>

<p>
I love this detail about how the best wine comes last (verse 2:10). It reminds
me of how in a life with Jesus, our love for Him and the sweetness of our
relationship can&#x2013;and should&#x2013;increase with time. He is the joy, hope and
sweentess of our lives, and this joy, hope, and sweetness should increase in
depth and intensity as we progress through life.
</p>

<p>
Next, we see the cleansing of the temple. Here, Christ drives out the
money-changers, who sought to take advantage of the faithful. When asked for His
authority to do this, or what is the point, Jesus' response is, "Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up." John is careful to bring out the
meaning of this: it's tied to His body, and His resurrection.
</p>

<p>
Now, His ministry had begun, and many began to beileve in Him because of His
signs (2:23).
</p>

<p>
<b>Take-aways</b>: pray with Mary; trust and obey Jesus; submit to His authority in
all things; stay close to Him in the Eucharist, His Body, which makes present
to us His death and resurrection.

<h3 id="org8276e9d">Genesis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8276e9d">
<p>
I list some major themes I identify as I read through Geneisis in the summer of 2025.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All of life is a test: will I follow and obey my will, or God's will?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This presupposes that I have the freedom to choose to obey God's will or
reject it.</li>
<li>Obedience to God's will is the pivotal question in life. It is the key to
the Lord's prayer: "Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven." In the Gospel, Christ speaks as if the
kingdom of heaven is at hand, or as if it has come. It has come, indeed,
in a hidden and mysterious way; it has not yet been fully revealed or
consummated on earth. Yet, when we obey God, we manifest His kingodm as
ambassadors, agents, or operatives of His kingdom.</li>
<li>We are given an intellect and a will. With the intellect, we can know God,
and with the will, we can obey God, which leads to an experiential knowing
of God, and a personal knowledge of God.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Adam and Eve.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They were presented with God's will in the garden, to live by His
command and within His boundaries.</li>
<li>In this story, we learn that we are not alone or isolated as we are
faced with the choice to do God's will or to choose our own way:
there is an enemy who hates God, and he hates us because we are made
in God's image, and God loves us.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The enemy's desire is to thwart or God's love for us by getting
us to disobey God, for he knows that in obedience to God's will,
we have life abundant; but in disobedience, we have death that
grieves God and destroys us forever</li>
<li>The enemy's objective is to get us to disobey and reject God's
will by:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Confusing us</li>
<li>Having us question God's will, His plan, and ultimately, His
goodness intent toward us</li>
<li>Causing us to be in fear, and thus to act blindly or foolishly
in ways contrary to God's will</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The temptation that Adam and Eve faced is the same as the temptation
that we face, and all those who came before us or will come after us
face: do we receive God's will as good and good for us, or do we
reject it in favor of our own vision, our own glory, or our own
desires and passions?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cain and Abel. Cain's sacrifice was lacking in some way, and God said
that sin was crouching at his doorstep. Cain refused to repent, and in
jealousy and perhaps pride, he added to his sin by killing his brother.</li>
<li>Enoch. Enoch walked with God and was no more. Apparently, he chose
God's will, and he walked in friendship with God.</li>
<li>Noah. He accepted God's task in faith to build an ark, despite the
fact that it took hundreds of years, and there is no evidence that
he even saw rain or flooding until the Great Flood.</li>
<li>The sons of Noah. Ham committed a great evil against his father by
"looking upon the nakedness of his father," and
Shem and Japheth chose to instead to cover the shame of their father.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Abraham
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Abraham and Hagar. Having received the promise of God of abundant
descendants, Abraham and Sarah apparently saw the sitation as
impossible, for Abraham was very old and Sarah was barren. They did not
know that nothing is too difficult for God, and they did not trust His
ability to fulfil His promise without their help or their action. So,
Sarah convinced Abraham to father a child through her handmaid, which
may have been a common practice in the ancient middle east. But, we who
follow Christ are not called to common practices, but rather
extraordinary lives.</li>
<li>Abraham and the King (x2). Having recieved the promise of abundant
descendants, Abraham feared for his life. On two occasions, he lied
and said that Sarah was not his wife, but his sister; for she was very
beautiful. He feared that he would be killed so that she could be
taken. Apparently, Abraham's fear was greater than his faith in God's
promise.</li>
<li>Abraham and the Sacrifice of Isaac. Having recieved the promise of abundant
descendants, Abraham was instructed to sacrifice his only son, whom he
loved. This was the son who was to inherit Abraham's covenant and
blessing. Now, Abraham had grown in his faith and trust in God to
beleive that even if he were to obey God, God would raise Isaac from
the dead so that He could fulfill His promise and His covenant.</li>
<li>Abraham and Lot.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Isaac and the King. Isaac also had an episode where he lied about
Rebeccah, his wife. He said she wasn't his wife.</li>
<li>Jacob. He spent his early life lying and conniving to get his way, notably
in deceiving his brother to give up his birthright and to get his father
to bless him as the firstborn in the place of Esau, his brother. This led
to being on the run for decades, where Jacob himself was cheated by his
uncle Laban. Eventually, Jacob left Laban, and he encountered God in such
a way his ability to run and flee was broken. Jacob was now left trusting
in God as he faced the possible wrath of his brother Esau, who at one
point sought to kill Jacob.</li>
<li>Joseph and his brothers.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>All of life is an invitation to know God, to pursue Him, and to be loved by
Him.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Personal invitations
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In creation&#x2013;and in our personal creation&#x2013;God gives us our first
invitation to know him.</li>
<li>As we grow through childhood, we develop and intelect and a will, which
enable us to know God personally through faith (knowledge), hope
(trust), and love (obedience).</li>
<li>At some point, we are invited to make the faith personal, to enter into
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cain was called to repent and to offer a better sacrifice.</li>
<li>Abraham was called to leave his father's household and journey to a land
that God had not yet shown to him.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What if Abraham had refused to go, or if he had said, "This can't be
real. I'm making this up"?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Abraham was called to:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Follow God on an unknown path, to step out of his comfort zone to a
journey with God.</li>
<li>live a life in light of God's promise to bless the
world though his innumerable descendants.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Joseph
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Since his youth, Joseph had been experiencing and dealing in dreams. He
had his own dreams, and he ws favord by his father above his brothers.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This favoritism bred contempt and hatred and jealousy among his
brothers for Joseph.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Great evil was done to Joseph: his brothers sought to kill him, but
settled for selling him into slavery.</li>
<li>Joseph found hound himself a slave to Potiphar, and there, he found
great favor from God with Potiphar.</li>
<li>Soon&#x2013;because of Potiphar's wife&#x2013;Joseph was in the prison of Pharaoh
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Potiphar could easily have killed Joseph for betraying him, but
he didn't.</li>
<li>Perhaps, by the grace of God, Potiphar knew Joseph's character
and that of his own wife, and so to protect Joseph, he had him
imprisoned elsewhere and away from Mrs. Potiphar.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, this was not for Joseph's</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We see reflections of Christ in Joseph:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Behold, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</li>
<li>Jospeh was innocent in all things, but he was betrayed by his brothers.</li>
<li>In a type of Christ's resurreciton, Joseph was abased in prison,
and later lifted up and exalted to the right hand of the king
Pharaoh, and he was given power and dominion over all of Egypt</li>
<li>We see Joseph forgive his brothers, recalling Christ's words,
"Forgive them, for they know not what they do."</li>

<blockquote>
<p>
26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city
of Galilee named Nazareth,
27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house
of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.
28 And having come in, the angel said to her, ``Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!''
</p>

<p>
29 But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and
considered what manner of greeting this was.
30 Then the angel said to her, ``Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
found favor with God. 
31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son,
and shall call His name Jesus. 
32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and
the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
33 And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.''
</p>

<p>
34 Then Mary said to the angel, ``How can this be, since I do not know a man?''
</p>

<p>
35 And the angel answered and said to her, ``The Holy Spirit will come
upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you;
therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the
Son of God.
36 Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her
old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called
barren.
37 For with God nothing will be impossible.''
</p>

<p>
38 Then Mary said, ``Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to
me according to your word.'' And the angel departed from her.

<p>
39 Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with
haste, to a city of Judah, 40 and entered the house of Zacharias and
greeted Elizabeth. 41 And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the
greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 Then she spoke out with a loud voice
and said, ``Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
your womb! 43 But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me? 44 For indeed, as soon as the voice of your
greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 45
Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of
those things which were told her from the Lord.''
</p>

<p>
46 And Mary said:
</p>

<p>
``My soul magnifies the Lord,
47 And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
48 For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;
For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.
49 For He who is mighty has done great things for me,
And holy is His name.
50 And His mercy is on those who fear Him
From generation to generation.
51 He has shown strength with His arm;
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
52 He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
And exalted the lowly.
53 He has filled the hungry with good things,
And the rich He has sent away empty.
54 He has helped His servant Israel,
In remembrance of His mercy,
55 As He spoke to our fathers,
To Abraham and to his seed forever.''
56 And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.

And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. 3 So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.
</p>

<p>
4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child. 6 So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. 7 And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
</p>

<p>
*8 Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the
fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.
9 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone 
around them, and they were greatly afraid.
10 Then the angel said to them, ``Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. 
11 For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 
12 And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.''
</p>

<p>
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
</p>

<p>
14 ``Glory to God in the highest,
And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!''
15 So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven,
that the shepherds said to one another, ``Let us now go to Bethlehem
and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made
known to us.''
16 And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph,
and the Babe lying in a manger.
17 Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
18 And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
20 Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.*
</p>

<p>
21 And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22 Now when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, ``Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord''),
24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, ``A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.''

by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the
Lord’s Christ.
27 So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when
the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the
custom of the law,
28 he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and
said:

According to Your word;
30 For my eyes have seen Your salvation

And the glory of Your people Israel.''

husband seven years from her virginity;
37 and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but
served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
38 And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all
those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgac3c73a">
<blockquote>
<p>
41 His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the
Passover. 42 And when He was twelve years old, they went up to
Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. 43 When they had
finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in
Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; 44 but supposing
Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought
Him among their relatives and acquaintances. 45 So when they did not
find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. 46 Now so it was
that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the
midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them
questions. 47 And all who heard Him were astonished at His
understanding and answers. 48 So when they saw Him, they were amazed;
and His mother said to Him, ``Son, why have You done this to us? Look,
Your father and I have sought You anxiously.''
</p>

<p>
49 And He said to them, “Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I
must be about My Father’s business?” 50 But they did not understand
the statement which He spoke to them.
</p>

<p>
51 Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was
subject to them, but His mother kept all these things in her
heart. 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
God and men.

<p>
36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to
the disciples, ``Sit here while I go and pray over there.'' 37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38 Then He said to them, ``My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.''
</p>

<p>
39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying,
``O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;
nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.''
</p>

<p>
40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, ``What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.''
</p>

<p>
42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, ``O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.'' 43 And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
</p>

<p>
44 So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying
the same words. 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them,
``Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and
the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise,
let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.''
</p>

<p>
47 And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.
</p>

<p>
48 Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ``Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.'' 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, ``Greetings, Rabbi!'' and kissed Him.
</p>

<p>
50 But Jesus said to him, ``Friend, why have you come?''
</p>

<p>
Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. 51 And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
</p>

<p>
52 But Jesus said to him, ``Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?''
</p>

<p>
55 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, ``Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me. 56 But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.''
</p>

<p>
Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.

33 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull, 34 they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But when He had tasted it, He would not drink.<br />
<br />
35 Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots,<br />
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: ``They<br />
divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots.''<br />
<br />
36 Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there. 37 And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him:<br />
<br />
THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br />
<br />
38 Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.<br />
<br />
39 And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads 40 and<br />
saying, ``You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save<br />
Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.''<br />
<br />
41 Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and<br />
elders, said, 42 ``He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is<br />
the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will<br />
believe Him. 43 He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will<br />
have Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' ''<br />
<br />
44 Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.<br />
<br />
45 Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, ``Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?'' that is, ``My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?''<br />
<br />
47 Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, ``This Man is calling for Elijah!'' 48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.<br />
<br />
49 The rest said, ``Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.''<br />
<br />
50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.<br />
<br />
51 Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, 52 and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 53 and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.<br />
<br />
54 So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, ``Truly this was the Son of God!''<br />
<br />
55 And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar, 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.<br />

1 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the<br />
mother of Jesus was there.<br />
2 Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.<br />
3 And when they ran out of wine, the mother of<br />
Jesus said to Him, ``They have no wine.''<br />

4 Jesus said to her, ``Woman, what does your concern have to do with<br />
Me? My hour has not yet come.''<br />

5 His mother said to the servants, ``Whatever He says to you, do it.''<br />
<br />
6 Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the<br />
manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty<br />
gallons apiece.<br />
7 Jesus said to them, ``Fill the waterpots with water.'' And they<br />
filled them up to the brim.<br />
8 And He said to them, ``Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast.'' And they took it.<br />
9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.<br />
10 And he said to him, ``Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the<br />
inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!''<br />

<p class="verse">
1 Now the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early,<br />
while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away<br />
from the tomb.<br />
2 Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the<br />
other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ``They have taken<br />
away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid<br />
Him.''<br />
<br />
3 Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to<br />
the tomb.<br />
4 So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran<br />
Peter and came to the tomb first. 5 And he, stooping down and looking<br />
in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in. 6 Then<br />
Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw<br />
the linen cloths lying there, 7 and the handkerchief that had been<br />
around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together<br />
in a place by itself. 8 Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb<br />
first, went in also; and he saw and believed. 9 For as yet they did<br />
not know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. 10 Then<br />
the disciples went away again to their own homes.<br />
<br />
11 But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she<br />
stooped down and looked into the tomb. 12 And she saw two angels in<br />
white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the<br />
body of Jesus had lain. 13 Then they said to her, ``Woman, why are you<br />
weeping?''<br />
<br />
She said to them, ``Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not<br />
know where they have laid Him.''<br />
<br />
14 Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus<br />
standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to<br />
her, ``Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?''<br />
<br />
She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, ``Sir, if You have<br />
carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him<br />
away.''<br />
<br />
16 Jesus said to her, ``Mary!''<br />
<br />
She turned and said to Him, ``Rabboni!'' (which is to say, Teacher).<br />
<br />
17 Jesus said to her, ``Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet<br />
ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I am<br />
ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.'<br />
''<br />
<br />
18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the<br />
Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.<br />
<br />
19 Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,<br />
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear<br />
of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them,<br />
``Peace be with you.'' 20 When He had said this, He showed them His<br />
hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the<br />
Lord.<br />
<br />
21 So Jesus said to them again, ``Peace to you! As the Father has sent<br />
Me, I also send you.'' 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on<br />
them, and said to them, ``Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive<br />
the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of<br />
any, they are retained.''<br />
<br />
24 Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them<br />
when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, ``We<br />
have seen the Lord.''<br />
<br />
So he said to them, ``Unless I see in His hands the print of the<br />
nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand<br />
into His side, I will not believe.''<br />
<br />
26 And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, ``Peace to you!''<br />
27 Then He said to Thomas, ``Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.''<br />
<br />
28 And Thomas answered and said to Him, ``My Lord and my God!''<br />
<br />
29 Jesus said to him, ``Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.''<br />

<p>
36 Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of
them, and said to them, ``Peace to you.'' 37 But they were terrified and
frightened, and supposed they had seen a spirit. 38 And He said to
them, ``Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?
39 Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and
see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.''
</p>

<p>
40 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 41
But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to
them, ``Have you any food here?'' 42 So they gave Him a piece of a
broiled fish and some honeycomb. 43 And He took it and ate in their
presence.
</p>

<p>
44 Then He said to them, ``These are the words which I spoke to you
while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which
were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms
concerning Me.'' 45 And He opened their understanding, that they might
comprehend the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
46 Then He said to them, ``Thus it is written, and thus it was
necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third
day, 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And you are
witnesses of these things. 49 Behold, I send the Promise of My Father
upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with
power from on high.''
</p>

<p>
50 And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands
and blessed them. 51 Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that
He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. 52 And they
worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 53 and were
continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.

<h4 id="org9120373">The Descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-41)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9120373">
<blockquote>
<p>
When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as
of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they
were sitting. 3 Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of
fire, and one sat upon each of them. 4 And they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
gave them utterance.
</p>

<p>
5 And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every
nation under heaven. 6 And when this sound occurred, the multitude
came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in
his own language. 7 Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to
one another, ``Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? 8 And how
is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?
9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia,
Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt
and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews
and proselytes, 11 Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our
own tongues the wonderful works of God.'' 12 So they were all amazed
and perplexed, saying to one another, ``Whatever could this mean?''
</p>

<p>
13 Others mocking said, ``They are full of new wine.''
</p>

<p>
14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said
to them, ``Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be
known to you, and heed my words. 15 For these are not drunk, as you
suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. 16 But this is
what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
</p>

<p>
17 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God,
That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;
Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
Your young men shall see visions,
Your old men shall dream dreams.
18 And on My menservants and on My maidservants
I will pour out My Spirit in those days;
And they shall prophesy.
19 I will show wonders in heaven above
And signs in the earth beneath:
Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
20 The sun shall be turned into darkness,
And the moon into blood,
Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.
21 And it shall come to pass
That whoever calls on the name of the Lord
Shall be saved.'
</p>

<p>
22 ``Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man
attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did
through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know— 23 Him, being
delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have
taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; 24 whom God
raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not
possible that He should be held by it. 25 For David says concerning
Him:
</p>

<p>
`I foresaw the Lord always before my face,
For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.
26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;
Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.
27 For You will not leave my soul in Hades,
Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
28 You have made known to me the ways of life;
You will make me full of joy in Your presence.'
</p>

<p>
29 ``Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch
David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to
this day. 30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had
sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to
the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, 31 he,
foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that
His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. 32
This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. 33
Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received
from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this
which you now see and hear.
</p>

<p>
34 ``For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:
</p>

<p>
'The Lord said to my Lord,
``Sit at My right hand,
35 Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.'' '
36 ``Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has
made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.''
</p>

<p>
37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to
Peter and the rest of the apostles, ``Men and brethren, what shall we
do?''
</p>

<p>
38 Then Peter said to them, ``Repent, and let every one of you be
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and
you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is
to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as
the Lord our God will call.''

The <i>New Advent</i> rosary sheet did not give a scripture reference for
this, so I chose Revelation 12.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with
the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She
was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3
Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with
seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 4 Its tail
swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the
earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give
birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. 5 She
gave birth to a son, a male child, who ``will rule all the nations with
an iron scepter.'' And her child was snatched up to God and to his
throne. 6 The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for
her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
</p>

<p>
7 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But he was
not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great
dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or
Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth,
and his angels with him.
</p>

<p>
10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
</p>

<p>
``Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our
God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers
and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been
hurled down. 11 They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and
by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much
as to shrink from death. 12 Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who
dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has
gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his
time is short.'' 
</p>

<p>
13 When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he
pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 The woman
was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the
place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken
care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s
reach. 15 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river,
to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 16 But the
earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river
that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. 17 Then the dragon was
enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her
offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony
about Jesus.
