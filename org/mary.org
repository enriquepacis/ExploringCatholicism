* Saint Mary
:properties:
:custom_id: mary
:end:
Saint Mary is regarded by Catholics as the pinnacle of Creation. We give her the
highest possible devotion without considering it worship. This is because while
God--in the Three Persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--is the eternal,
infinite, immaterial, and uncreated Creator. Mary, however dignified, is part of the Creator's creation:
like the rest of creation, she has a beginning, and she is finite. However, she
plays a unique role in the cosmic drama of salvation, for the immaterial,
eternal, and unchanging Son received His temporal, material, and changing human
body from Mary through the work of the Holy Spirit. By her obedience and
subservience to God, she became a portal of the Divine. God has approached us
indeed, and He has done so in Jesus Christ through Mary, His mother.

Personally, I have a love and admire Mary for three principal reasons:
1. She is a spiritual mother for all Christians
2. She is an instigator of grace
3. She is an intercessor
4. She is an example

** Mary as Mother

The Bible implicitly and explicitly tells us that Mary is the mother for all believers.

*** Implicit Biblical Evidence

*** Explicit Biblical Origins of St. Mary as Mother

The explicit Scriptural revelation of Mary's motherhood comes from
Revelation 12. Here, John the Revelator has a vision of a dragon, a woman
crowned with twelve stars, and a Child, who was borne of the woman. Verse 5
makes it clear that the Child is none other than Jesus Christ Himself:
#+begin_quote
5 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an
iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.

(Revelation 12:5, RSVCE)
#+end_quote
The dragon is explicitly identified as Satan:
#+begin_quote
 9 The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or
 Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his
 angels with him.

 (Revelation 12:9, RSVCE)
#+end_quote

Who is the woman? Catholics may argue she is Mary; Protestants argue she is
Israel. Still another interpretation is that she is the Church. Let us examine
the characteristics of the woman as identified in Revelation 12.

First, we see that she gave birth to Jesus Christ. This could clearly be Mary,
but it could also be Israel, since Jesus was born an Israelite of the tribe of
Judah. Additionally, the twelve stars could be a strong allusion to the twelve
tribes of Israel. One argument for the woman to be an individual (Mary) is one
of symmetry: the dragon is an individual, and the Child is an individual, so we
should expect the woman to be an individual rather than a collective identity
(the Church or Israel)

Another very revealing passige is verse 17:
#+begin_quote
17 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the
rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their
testimony about Jesus.

(Revelation 12:17, RSVCE)
#+end_quote
The woman is said to be the mother to all believers, those who keep God's
commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus. The fact that the woman is
the mother to believers in Jesus Christ could make her the Church; however, the
Church did not give birth to Jesus, but rather, Jesus gave birth to the
Church. It cannot be Israel, for after Jesus' incarnation Israel (the Jews) has
rejected the testimony of Jesus, and they deny He is the Messiah.

When we summarize these possiblilties in a table and rate on a scale of 0-10 how
each candidate fits the description, it is clear that St. Mary best fits the
identity of the magnificent woman in this passage.

| Characteristic               | Verses | Mary | Church | Israel |
|------------------------------+--------+------+--------+--------|
| Gave birth to Jesus Christ   |      5 |   10 |      0 |     10 |
| Mother to followers of Jesus |     17 |   10 |     10 |      0 |

If we can accept this explicit Scriptural testimony that St. Mary is the mother
of all Christians, then we can recognize that she is also a queen (Revelation
12:1). In fact, this aligns with the Israelite model for queenship. The queen
was not the wife of king, for the king could have many wives, and it may not be
clear who was the favorite. Rather, the queen was the mother of the king, as
illustrated by Solomon and his mother Bathsheba. Thus, since Jesus is the King
of Heaven (and indeed, the King of the Universe), St. Mary is the Queen of Heaven.


** Mary as an Instigator of Grace

Catholics look to St. Mary as an important instigator of grace; but, she is not
the originator of grace. God, of course, is the source of all graces. However,
St. Mary plays a special role in salvation history. First and foremost, St. Mary
embraced God's will when it was presented to her by the archangel,
St. Gabriel. In response to her /fiat/, she conceived by the Holy Spirit, and
received the Son of God into her body, providing Christ with His body through her biology and the
work of the Holy Spirit. Her cooperation with God's will thus enabled the
Incarnation of Christ. Through St. Mary, the unchanging and eternal Son of God
entered into time and space as Jesus Christ, the source of all graces together
with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Thus, since St. Mary is the portal of
God the Son into His creation, and the Son brings us all graces, St. Mary has
been called the "portal of grace" or the "gate of heaven."

Nonetheless, it should be noted that St. Mary is not the ultimate cause of our
graces. Rather, God, in His generosity created humanity and willed St. Mary to 
exist. Furthermore, in His grace and generosity, He invited her to participate
in His plan of salvation for mankind by accepting the role chosen for her. Her
willing cooperation with God's will and invitation, then, led to Christ's life,
death and resurrection.

For St. Mary's supporting and enabling role in humanity's redemption through
Christ, St. Mary is known as the *New Eve*. This is because her role is the
antithesis of Eve's role in Adam's sin and the Fall. This is described in more
detail below.

#+caption: Mary is the antithesis of Eve. Whereas Eve fell prey to Satan through disobedience, Mary triumphed over him by her great fiat in response to God's will: "Let it be done unto your servant as you have said." Eve's action led to Adam's sin, the fall of man, and spiritual death. Mary's obedience led to the incarnation of Christ, His holy life, death, and resurrection, purchasing for us redemption and eternal life.

The Scriptures explicitly call Jesus the Last Adam ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A45-49&version=RSVCE][1 Cor. 15:45-49]],
[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A12-21&version=RSVCE][Rom. 5:12-21]]). Nonetheless, within 100 years of the writing of the last books of
the Bible--indeed, before the notion of the Bible even existed--the early Church
fathers recognized a stunning parallel between Eve and Mary. Let us tabulate
some details for comparison and contrast:

Mary is called the *New Eve* because her faithful obedience to God's will
reversed the disobedience of Eve. Where Eve’s disobedience led to the Fall and
death, Mary’s obedience opened the way for the Incarnation and the gift of
eternal life through Jesus Christ, the New Adam (cf. Romans 5:12–21; 1
Corinthians 15:22, 45). 

Eve is seen as the "mother of all the living" (Genesis 3:20), but her action
brought spiritual death into the world. Mary, through her "yes" to God at the
Annunciation (Luke 1:38), becomes the spiritual mother of all the redeemed. 

*Who first made this observation?*

The typology of Mary as the New Eve appears very early in Christian theology:

| *Church Father*        | *Date*        | *Contribution*                                                                                   |
|------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *St. Justin Martyr*    | c. 155–165 AD | In *Dialogue with Trypho*, he compares Eve’s disobedience with Mary’s obedience.                 |
| *St. Irenaeus of Lyon* | c. 180–190 AD | In *Against Heresies*, he develops the parallel more fully, calling Mary the cause of salvation. |

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*"The knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary."*  
— *St. Irenaeus*, *Against Heresies* 3.22.4  
#+END_QUOTE

*When did this occur relative to the canon of Scripture?*

The New Eve typology was articulated decades *before* the biblical canon was finalized:

| *Event or Text*                          | *Approximate Date* |
|------------------------------------------+--------------------|
| Justin Martyr’s *Dialogue with Trypho*   | c. 155–165 AD      |
| Irenaeus’ *Against Heresies*             | c. 180–190 AD      |
| Muratorian Fragment (early canon list)   | c. 170–200 AD      |
| Council of Hippo (affirmed canon)        | 393 AD             |
| Council of Carthage                      | 397 AD             |

So the New Eve theology *predates* the Church's formal listing of the biblical canon by over 200 years.

*Would this concept have been known to the bishops who determined the canon?*

Yes. The Eve–Mary typology was already *well established* in orthodox Christian
teaching by the time the canon was finalized. Bishops and theologians at the
Councils of Hippo and Carthage would likely have been familiar with:

- The teachings of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus
- The biblical typology between Eve and Mary (Genesis–Luke connection)
- The importance of Mary’s obedience as part of salvation history

This typology supported a *unified understanding* of Scripture and Tradition in
the early Church.

*The relationship between the Marian typology and the canon of the Scriptures* is
important because it *undermines* the claim made by many that Catholic
veneration of Mary is unscriptural. It is certainly *not* unscriptural or
antiscriptural, since the councils of bishops who were identifying which books
to call Scripture would have been aware of Marian typology, and they would never
have called Scripture books that undermine this.

Additionally, the wedding at Cana gives us a second picture of St. Mary as an
instigator of grace. She recognized the problematic situation, and she brought
it to the attention of Jesus Christ, her Son. He expressed that it was not His
will to resolve the situation at that time. Nonetheless, at her propmting and
instruction to do whatever He tells them, the people involved approached
Christ. He then acted, performing His first public miracle, commencing His
ministry in a public way.
