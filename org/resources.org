** How to Go Deeper

If you feel God's prompting to explore Catholicism, or if you simply want to
learn more, you have several options.
1. Adults may enroll in the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults
   (OCIA). Typically free of charge, this entails several months of classroom
   instruction and, if you wish, it will culminate in the three sacraments of
   Christian initiation: baptism, confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist. This is
   focused on orienting an individual toward a lifelong journey of discipleship
   and service to Christ.

   Typically, OCIA courses commence in the fall (around August or September) and
   conclude with batpisms, confirmations, and first communion around Easter.

   Local to the Waco area are offerings by several Catholic parishes or centers:
   1. [[https://baylorcatholic.org][St. Peter's Catholic Student Center]] at the edge of Baylor's campus caters
      heavily to Baylor's students. Faculty, staff, and friends of the
      university also participate at St. Peter's. The OCIA courses at
      St. Peter's are called the [[https://baylorcatholic.org/catholicism-1][Basic Teachings]], and typically take place on Monday
      nights. 
   2. [[https://stlouiswaco.com][St. Louis Catholic Church]] is a family-friendly parish that also runs the
      only Catholic school in Waco. St. Louis is a thriving parish, with over
      1000 families represented. In 2024, St. Louis grew from about 1300
      families to over 1900 families. You may [[https://stlouiswaco.com/rcia][sign up]] for the St. Louis OCIA
      program.
   3. [[https://stjosephwaco.com][St. Joseph Catholic Church]] is located close to the Baylor Campus. Less
      student-centric and more family-oriented, St. Jospeh also offers [[https://stjosephwaco.com/ocia][OCIA]].

   There are also several other parishes in the Waco area that offer OCIA.

2. If you are so excited and so moved that you don't want to wait for OCIA
   (you'll eventually have to take it, unless you are exceptionally prepared; an
   interview with a priest may reveal that you are ready to be initiated right
   away).

   You can begin learning on your own. Fr. John Riccardo is a great catechist
   and evangelist, and this [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2oBIjKcCFUI03M67Wk14mfqN4fTFVfkE][YouTube playlist]] has a full set of OCIA courses for
   his parish. /Note: when these videos were created, OCIA was called the Rite
   of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA)/.

[[https://www.ewtn.com/radio/shows/called-to-communion][Called to Communion]] is an hour-long live call-in radio show with a [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9CQlldupc5-V0O8pdxElKJMjJmC7Hfdc&si=UHBUulMLByPVEyVs][YouTube
livestream]]. Here, Dr. David Anders, a Presbyterian-turned-Catholic, answers
hard-hitting questions, especially those from Protestants. The show airs at 1:00
PM Central Time on weekdays. The show tagline is, "What is stopping you from
becoming Catholic?" Dr. Anders was a student and friend to the late
Dr. R.C. Sproul. Dr. Anders has a very broad and very deep knowledge of the
Protestant Reformation and the early Church Fathers.

Here's another fun excerpt of a show. Here, Giovanni, a transgender individual
gives a testimonial about how is faith was bolstered by a talk with Dr. Anders.

** The Coming Home Network

The [[https://chnetwork.org/converts/][Coming Home Network]] was established to help non-Catholic Christians, clergy
and laity, discover the truth and beauty of Catholicism and to make the journey
home to the Catholic Church. This site has numerous [[https://chnetwork.org/converts/][conversion stories]] ([[https://chnetwork.org/category/all-stories/][full
archive)]] of people from various backgrounds who converted to Catholicisim. A
number of Evangelical Protestants, pastors, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, and more.

As an example, here is the story of Eddie Trask, who, like me, is a Catholic who
lived as an Evangelical Protestant and then came back to Catholicism.

** Miscellaneous Beautiful Teachings

*** Theology of The Body

Christopher West gives a very nice introductory talk on the Theology of The Body
as a gift from Pope St. John Paul II to the world in terms of human
dignity. This talk discusses how erotic love was designed by God to propel us
toward God.

Dr. Anders discusses how we make progress toward holiness and spiritual union
with God. The Church has well-defined methods for quitting sin and gaining
intimacy with Christ.

*** End Times?

**** The Nation-state of Israel
:properties:
:custom_id: end-times-israel
:end:

On Jun 18, 2025, as the Israel-Iran conflict was heating up, Tony called
Dr. David Anders about the modern state of Israel and God's blessing. Father Dan 
Rehill made an appearance on the Sean Ryan Show ([[https://youtu.be/0svd0YPi-9I?si=Vp4QpVHZZSPv24yn&t=8069][Episode 141]]), and he seemed to
teach that anyone who messes with Israel will be frustrated by the hand of
God. Dr. Anders addresses this belief: Israel does not get a free pass to commit
genocide and atrocity. The prophecies of blessing are not fulfilled in Israel,
but rather in the Person of Jesus Christ. Rather, God seeks that His people life
justly. /My own observation: God punished His people quite harshly in the Old
Testament for their own idolatry, sin, and injustice. Those who claim to be
God's people need to be sure they are on the side of justice, love, and mercy./
Dr. Anders also highlights [[https://www.kairospalestine.ps][Kairos Palestine]], an eccumenical Christian
organization that advocates for the end to Israeli acts of opression and
injustice committed against Palestinian Christians.

** Beautiful Books

*** Books I've Read
I can only recommend books I've read. There is so much to read, so much to
learn. Here, I list some books that have been very illuminating for me. First
and foremost is the Bible, of course, for this is an important and infallible
piece of revelation from God. Aside from the Bible, however, I can list some titles.

**** St. Augustine of Hippo. /The Confessions/ (autobiography)
This book fans the flames of my love for Jesus.

**** St. Augustine of Hippo. /City of God/
This book leaves me in awe of St. Augustine's insights.

**** Mark Twain. /Joan of Arc/ ([[https://www.amazon.com/Joan-Arc-Mark-Twain/dp/0898702682/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QGPMF80XE9BN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bEVTIU9xaOnh_8t9FwVRaQ6Q5moqqsfoq_-KrcNIL7J838KcAgWm0_gzyHEdEqYMhkSMCdzshtJuozWMoh5nSzYNL3r6eW8JYcXJmNxJd6Kl0cKpKS9gLqxHvWPduiaoxynfmAU3GcreDSQxYyW17urAeBmwMHfVlPFj2Vn5lidaECberi4S_yskgqozi3za4BtaESOpyJ7bYe5uAfkEvReMHE5xl7NcKUc_wk5kg3Y.FIFh0_shS-g8NhGX4QrSnLbCtRAYhoRUqxVp8bxT0_Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=mark+twain+joan+of+arc&qid=1747110616&s=books&sprefix=mark+twain+joan%2Cstripbooks%2C126&sr=1-1][Amazon.com]])

** Mother Angelica

Mother Angelica is known for founding the Eternal Word Television Network
(EWTN, see [[https://www.ewtn.com][ewtn.com]]), the largest religious media network in the world. Her
wisdom, humor and charm come out in conversation. Yet, she was a woman of deep
conviction, and this is why she is one of my personal heroines: Mother Angelica
knew Jesus deeply and personally, and she understood His calling on her life. To
serve Him was her love and her mission, and whenever she was convinced that God
wanted her to do something, she would not allow anyone or anythihng to stand in
her way.

**** Silence of Heart and Mind - 1998.07.28

Mother Angelica discusses spending time with the Lord in prayer.

Phone calls focus on:
- Experiencing the presence of Jesus as we spend time in the World. This can be
  referred to as "being a contemplative in the real world."
- Extreme irritation with and anger for a relative
  - Surrender to the Lord
- Difficulty staying awake in Adoration
  - Look for natural causes prior to supernatural causes
  - Contemplation is sitting with Jesus and being content
  - Spritual dryness can be our friend, a gift from God. God allows us to learn
    to love Him for Himself, not for consoluations or spiritual blessings. God
    can teach us to love Him without getting anything out of it. We aspire to
    love Jesus for Himself, not for what He gives us or because of His miracles.

*** /Sola Scriptura/

Sam argues from the Scriptures that God appointed the Church as the pillar of
truth (1 Timothy 3:15). But the Church of the first, second, third, fourth,
fifth centuries, etc., did not teach like the Reformed Christians of the 16th
century.
