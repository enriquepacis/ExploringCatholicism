** How to Go Deeper

If you feel God's prompting to explore Catholicism, or if you simply want to
learn more, you have several options.
1. Adults may enroll in the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults
   (OCIA). Typically free of charge, this entails several months of classroom
   instruction and, if you wish, it will culminate in the three sacraments of
   Christian initiation: baptism, confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist. This is
   focused on orienting an individual toward a lifelong journey of discipleship
   and service to Christ.

   Typically, OCIA courses commence in the fall (around August or September) and
   conclude with batpisms, confirmations, and first communion around Easter.

   Local to the Waco area are offerings by several Catholic parishes or centers:
   1. [[https://baylorcatholic.org][St. Peter's Catholic Student Center]] at the edge of Baylor's campus caters
      heavily to Baylor's students. Faculty, staff, and friends of the
      university also participate at St. Peter's. The OCIA courses at
      St. Peter's are called the [[https://baylorcatholic.org/catholicism-1][Basic Teachings]], and typically take place on Monday
      nights. 
   2. [[https://stlouiswaco.com][St. Louis Catholic Church]] is a family-friendly parish that also runs the
      only Catholic school in Waco. St. Louis is a thriving parish, with over
      1000 families represented. In 2024, St. Louis grew from about 1300
      families to over 1900 families. You may [[https://stlouiswaco.com/rcia][sign up]] for the St. Louis OCIA
      program.
   3. [[https://stjosephwaco.com][St. Joseph Catholic Church]] is located close to the Baylor Campus. Less
      student-centric and more family-oriented, St. Jospeh also offers [[https://stjosephwaco.com/ocia][OCIA]].

   There are also several other parishes in the Waco area that offer OCIA.

2. If you are so excited and so moved that you don't want to wait for OCIA
   (you'll eventually have to take it, unless you are exceptionally prepared; an
   interview with a priest may reveal that you are ready to be initiated right
   away).

   You can begin learning on your own. Fr. John Riccardo is a great catechist
   and evangelist, and this [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2oBIjKcCFUI03M67Wk14mfqN4fTFVfkE][YouTube playlist]] has a full set of OCIA courses for
   his parish. /Note: when these videos were created, OCIA was called the Rite
   of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA)/.

livestream]]. Here, Dr. David Anders, a Presbyterian-turned-Catholic, answers
hard-hitting questions, especially those from Protestants. The show airs at 1:00
PM Central Time on weekdays. The show tagline is, "What is stopping you from
becoming Catholic?" Dr. Anders was a student and friend to the late
Dr. R.C. Sproul. Dr. Anders has a very broad and very deep knowledge of the
Protestant Reformation and the early Church Fathers.

Here's another fun excerpt of a show. Here, Giovanni, a transgender individual
gives a testimonial about how is faith was bolstered by a talk with Dr. Anders.

Christopher West gives a very nice introductory talk on the Theology of The Body
as a gift from Pope St. John Paul II to the world in terms of human
dignity. This talk discusses how erotic love was designed by God to propel us
toward God.

** Beautiful Books

*** Books I've Read
I can only recommend books I've read. There is so much to read, so much to
