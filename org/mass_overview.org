* The Mass: an Overview

** Introduction

I cannot give a comprehensive overview of the Mass here, since many works have
been written over two millenia about this. Instead, I will attempt to give my
understanding of the Mass to provide an overview for beginners.

#+begin_info
*The Mass is Mind-blowing*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read this to have your mind blown ...</summary>

Central to the Mass is the Eucharist, which we believe is truly the Body, Blood,
Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ. This reality makes present the Paschal
mystery, which is an act of God that happened in our history and yet transcends
time. This is discussed in paragraph [[https://www.catholiccrossreference.online/catechism/#!/search/1085][1085]] of the Catechism of the Catholic
Church:
#+begin_quote
In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal mystery that
Christ signifies and makes present. During his earthly life Jesus announced his
Paschal mystery by his teaching and anticipated it by his actions. When his Hour
comes, he lives out the unique event of history which does not pass away: Jesus
dies, is buried, rises from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of the
Father "once for all."8 His Paschal mystery is a real event that occurred in our
history, but it is unique: all other historical events happen once, and then
they pass away, swallowed up in the past. The Paschal mystery of Christ, by
contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because by his death he destroyed
death, and all that Christ is — all that he did and suffered for all men —
participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends all times while being
made present in them all. The event of the Cross and Resurrection abides and
draws everything toward life.
#+end_quote

What does this mean to me? It means that when I partake of the Eucharist, I am
uniting myself with the eternal Christ in the present moment. I am not communing
with Christ and just those people around me; rather, in Christ, I am communing with all
Christians--past, present, future, near and far--who also have joined themselves
to Jesus.

The Mass is a cosmic event in which our Creator approaches us, gives Himself to
us, and we approach Him. In receiving His Body and Blood, we also give ourselves
to Him in an encounter that is more intimate than any act that spouses can
perform.

Eastern Orthodox Christians also believe their liturgy (public worship) to be a
cosmic event where heaven meets earth and angels participate. This is because
they--like Catholics, Coptics, Armenians, and many other Christians--believe
that Christ is truly present in the consecrated bread and wine. What Catholics
call the /Mass/, Orthodox Christians call the  /Divine Liturgy/. In the video
below, an Eastern Orthodox Christian describes the Divine Liturgy in much the
same way we Catholics view the Mass. The Mass is full of mystery and Divine
love.

#+html: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2uvXjjDjwQ?si=cLWx_sCDyLrEQY30&amp;start=109" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Like the Orthodox Christians, if we truly
understood the Mass, we would approach it with great awe and wonder, recognizing
it as a holy and intimate encounter with the Creator of the universe, our great
Divine Lover, and the Source of our very lives. In the Mass, we come into
contact with Him who is both our Origin and our Destination.

** An Interpretive Lens: the Eucharist

Understanding the Eucharist--that is, the elements of Communion--is perhaps the
most important key to understanding the Catholic Mass and the Catholic
worldview. Common among the apostolic Christians is the belief that *Jesus
Christ is truly present in the elements of Communion*, called *the Eucharist* in
the Catholic Church. By /apostolic Christians/, we mean the Christian churches
established throughout the centuries /prior/ to the Protestant Reformation, such
as the Armenians, the Copts, the Syro-Malabar Christians, the Greek Orthodox,
the Russian Orthodox, etc. 

#+caption: Catholics and generally all ancient apostolic Christians sects founded prior to the Protestant Reformation accept the teaching that the Eucharist (the elements of Communion) truly are the flesh and blood of Christ. This teaching is derived from the teachings of Jesus ([[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-71&version=RSVCE][John 6:22-71 RSVCE]], the writings of St. Paul, the earliest believers--such as St. Ignatius of Antioch, a student of John the Evangelist ([[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm][Epistle to the Smyrnaeans]], ch. 6-7), and numerous [[https://www.churchfathers.org/the-real-presence][church fathers]]. Additionally, several Protestant founders such as [[https://www.detroitcatholic.com/voices/luther-s-defense-of-the-real-presence-in-the-eucharist][Martin Luther]], John Calvin, and others upheld the teaching of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
#+attr_html: :width 640px
[[./img/holy-eucharist-992x480_jpg_1200x.webp.jpeg]]


The belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the elements of the 
Eucharist is referred to the /Real Presence/ of Christ in the Eucharist. Among
churches that hold to the Real Presence, there are a subtle variety of vies. The
specific version of the Real Presence taught by the Catholic  church involves
/transubstantiation/.

Transubstantiation means that what *looks* like bread is God. Initially, it was
was made as bread. It has all the outward appearances (technically, called the
/accidents/) of bread, and in its essence or /substance/, it is bread. However,
at the words of consecration ("This is my body" or "This is the cup of my
blood"), bread and wine are changed in substance from bread and wine to the very
flesh and blood of God.

For apostolic Christians, this means that being in the presence of the Eucharist
is a very holy occasion, since it is the very presence of Jesus Christ, the
living God. This makes such occasions every bit as holy as the encounter Moses
had with the burning bush:
#+begin_quote
1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the
mountain of God. 2 And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire
from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with
fire, but the bush was not consumed. 3 Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside
and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.” 

4 So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the
midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” 

And he said, “Here I am.”

5 Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet,
for the place where you stand is holy ground.” 6 Moreover He said, “I am the God
of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A1-5&version=NKJV][Exodus 3:1-5 (NKJV)]]
#+end_quote

** The Mass as an Intimate Dance with God

Because of the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the Mass provides a real
and intimate way for us to have contact with our Lord. I like to think of it as
an intimate dance with the Divine, or perhaps as a call and response between a
Divne lover, and me, His beloved.

The Mass can be divided roughly into two parts: the Liturgy of the Word, and the
Liturgy of the Eucharist. *We can think of the Liturgy of the Word as God's
divine call to us, and the Liturgy of the Eucharist as our human response to
God's call.* In the Liturgy of the Word, we hear God's call to obey or respond
in faith. In the Liturgy of the Eucharist, we offer the sacrifice of prayer and
the very Body and Blood of Christ to God the Father on our behalf. This
culminates in our reception of the Eucharist, in which we respond to God by
receiving Him into our bodies in an act more intimate than even the marital act
between husband and wife. In so doing, we must be properly disposed to receivng
Christ. In this moment, Christ gives Himself fully and completely to us, and we
give ourselves fully and compeletly to Christ, with a commitment to obey Him.

We expand further on these two parts of the Mass.

*** The Liturgy of the Word
The Liturgy of the Word  contains the introductory rites and readings of
Scripture. It culminates with a reading from the Gospel, for which we stand in
honor of Jesus, acknowledging His presence (non-Eucharistic) in the reading of
the Gospels (the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The 
ligurgy of the Word then typically concludes 
with a homily, in which the priest helps us connect the readings with our
present lives and draws on how we may apply the Word of God personally
today. Depending on the day of the week or the liturgical calendar, there may be
a profession of the Nicene creed. This completes the divine call in the Liturgy
of the Word.

#+begin_info
*The Word of God*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>
The *word of God* is typically interpreted in two ways: (1) as either Scriptures
(writings) or a spoken word, or (2) as Jesus Christ Himself.

Christians consider the Scriptures to be the divinely-inspired Word of God in written form. Here, when
you see /Word/, think /revelation/ of God. The fullest revelation of God is
Jesus Christ, God in human form. See [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1-18&version=RSVCE][John 1:1-18]] and [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A1-3&version=NIV][Hebrews 1:1-3]].

Interestingly, Hebrews 4:12 is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as a reference
to the Bible. A close reading of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A12-13&version=RSVCE][Hebrews 4:12-13]] reveals that Jesus is the subject
here, not a collection of writings:
#+begin_quote
12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword,
piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And before him no
creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom
we have to do. 
#+end_quote
In verse 12, the English "word" is λόγος (/logos/) in the Greek, and this is
these same λόγος as in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=RSVCE][John 1:1]], which is none other than Jesus Christ, our
Lord.  Additionally, verse 13 uses the pronoun /him/, referring back to the
previous subject, the λόγος of God.

#+html: </details>
#+end_info

*** The Liturgy of the Eucharist
After the homily, we transition to the liturgy of the Eucharist. The climax of
the liturgy of the Eucharist is when the priest consecrates the bread and wine,
transforming it to the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, followed by the personal
reception of the Body and Blood by the Catholic faithful. When receiving the
Eucharist, we are declaring with our actions that we believe in all the
teachings of the Catholic Church, and we are offering ourselves to God, just as
He offers Himself to us in the Eucharist. We highlight several
parts of the liturgy of the Eucharist::
1. It may begin with a period of /intercession/, where the church prays together
   for various needs.
2. Then, there will be an offering of the people (an offering collection plate
   or basket is passed around), and the bread and wine that will become the Body
   and Blood of Jesus at the /Consecration/.  The bread and wine also are
   regarded as /gifts/ from the faithful
3. The priest then prepares the gifts to serve as the offering. He says prayers
   for himself and the people and the church.
4. Finally, when the altar is prepared, the priest invites us to pray with him
   for what will become a sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood in Eucharistic
   form to God. We stand and respond in prayer, finally concluding with "Holy,
   Holy, Holy, is the Lord God almighty. Heaven and earth are full of Your
   glory. Hosana in the highest. Hosana in the highest." Then, we kneel as the
   priest undrtakes the holiest part of the Mass, the Consecration of the gifts.
5. The Consecration begins with prayers by the priest. He shows the bread to the
   faithful and recites teh words of Jesus, bowing. WHen says, "This is my
   Body," we believe that the Holy Spirit works through the priest to
   transubstantiate the bread: it is no longer bread, but God Himself, in His
   fullness--Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. The consecration of the bread is
   followed by the priest elevating the Body of Christ.

   Similarly, the priest consecrates the wine with the words of Jesus, "... this
   is the chalice of my blood ...", followed by an elevation.
6. Next, we pray the Lord's prayer, inviting God to be Lord of our lives with
   the words, "...Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done..."
7. Following this, the Catholic faithful are invited to receive the Body and
   Blood of Christ. This is the most intimate interaction we can have with God
   in this present life, and far more intimate than any act of intimacy we can
   perform with another human.

   Non-Catholics and Catholics not properly prepared to receive the Eucharist
   also may approach, but they should not receive. Catholics and 
   non-Catholics alike can indicate their intention *not to receive* by crossing
   their arms in front of their chest. The priest or Eucharistic minister will
   then give a blessing. I recommend non-Catholics and unprepared Catholics
   still approach the priest or Eucharistic minister, since this allows a better
   flow of people. The faithful return to their pews and kneel reverently in
   prayer of thanksgiving for the great and intimate gift of Christ's Body that
   He himself gives us.
8. The priest will then cleanse the sacred vessels, give closing prayers and a
   blessing, and dismiss the Mass with the words, "Mass is ended. Go in peace."

** The Mass as Two-fold a Sacrifice
The Catholic teaching is that the Mass is a holy sacrifice. Actually, it is
two-fold. One sacrifice is by the priest, who sacrifices the Body and Blood of Jesus to God the Father on
behalf of the Church. The other sacrifice is that of the lay faithful, who
present their bodies to God as a living offering, in accordance with [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A1-2&version=NKJV][Romans
12:1-2]].

** Special Masses and Liturgies

*** Holy Thursday: The Mass that doesn't End
This Mass commemorates the Last Supper, the first Mass of all Masses, which was
instituted by Christ Himself.

This Mass deosn't end with the words, "Mass is ended. Go in peace." Instead, it
ends in silence. Typically, the priest will consecrate extra Eucharist for use
on Good Friday (the Solemn Liturgy of the Lord's Passion), a day when no Mass is
held throughout the world. Instead of ending the Mass explicitly, the extra
Eucharist is taken to an altar of repose in a solemn procession. There, Christ
will be adored by the lay faithful, who will wait with Him. The idea here is to
waith with Christ, much like His disciples did during His agony in the Garden of
Gethsemane in the time leading up to His betrayal, but without falling asleep.

It is a tradition for parishes to keep their altar of repose open until midnight.

*** TODO Good Friday: the Solemn Liturgy of the Lord's Passion

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Isenheim_Altarpiece_—_FIRST_OPENING.jpg]]

This is not a Mass because the Eucharist is not consecrated on Good Friday
around the world. Instead, consecrated hosts from the Holy Thursday Mass are
distributed so that the faithful may receive Christ on this day. The Liturgy
includes a long set of intercessions for the world, as well as a prayer called
the Litany of the Saints. Additionally, there is a ceremony called the
Veneration of the Cross, where the faithful and the clergy express their
gratitude to Jesus by showing reverence to a crucifix as a sign of Christ's
generous love for us. For a church with hundreds of attendees, this can be a
lengthy protion of the Liturgy. The Ligurgy concludes after the faithful receive
the Eucharist.

*** TODO Holy Saturday: the Easter Vigil Mass

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Paolo_Veronese_-_The_Resurrection_of_Christ_-_WGA24817.jpg]]

The Easter Vigil Mass is the pinnacle of the liturgical year. It is the Mass of
Masses. Even more than Good Friday was a somber reflection of Christ's, passion,
the Easter Vigil is full of expectant desire of His Resurrection, and jubilant
triumph over the historical fact of the matter. This is the first Mass since
Holy Thursday, and the readings give a grand panoramic view of salvation
history, starting with Creation and the Fall, up through the Resurrection and
the present day.

The *Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist*, often abbreviated to the /Real
Presence/, is the teaching or belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the
elements of Communion. This is to be contrasted with a more symbolist view,
which was first espoused by Ulrich Zwingli in the first Zurich disputation
(January 1523).

Today, many more evangelical Protestant denominations hold to
the Zwinglian symbolist view. However, the Real Presence has been the view
upheld by Church fathers since the writing of the Gospels, the early decades of
the Church, and down through the centuries. It is so prevalent that all
apostolic Christian churches--those churches established prior to the Protestant
Reformation, such as the Armenians, the Copts, the Chaldeans, the Greek
Orthodox, Ethiopean Orthodox, etc.--all uphold the Real Presence in a corporeal
sense. Additionally, Martin Luther himself upheld the Real Presence in debate
against Zwingli's symbolist position. John Calvin and John Wesley are other
notable Protestant leaders and founders who believed in and taught a form of the
Real Presence, though they espoused a more spiritual version of the Real
Presence. Zwingli's symbolist view emerged as a significant unorthodox
theological novelty after the Real Presence dominated Chistian thought and 
teaching for the first 16 centuries of Christianity. In the symbolist view, the
Real Presence is rejected, and communion is simply a rememberance of Christ's
passion.

#+begin_info
*The Real Presence and Transubstantiation*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>More information ...</summary>

The Real Presence refers to the teaching that Christ is truly present in the
elements of Communion of which we as Christians partake. The Catholic teaching
is a /corporeal/ real presence, since the Catholic Church teaches that the
Eucharist is Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. In particular, the Catholic
teaching is called *transubstantiation*. This means that the /substance/ or
/essence/ of the elements of communion--that is, what they _are_--has been
changed from the substance of bread and wine to the substance of God Himself in
the Second Person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ. The bread and wine are gone, and
all that is present is Jesus Christ Himself, even though the Eucharist retains the
/accidents/ of bread and wine. /Accidents/ are those properties that can be
physically experienced, measured, or observed. Thus according to the doctrine of
transubstantiation, we can never tell from appearances or even intense study
that the Eucharist is anything other than Bread and Wine; however, because of
the testimony of Jesus Christ Himself, we receive by faith that the Eucharist is
actually Christ. Additionally, the Eucharist is not a part of Christ (not a
finger or a piece of skin or a portion of liver); rather it is /all/ of Christ
in a non-extensible way. By non-extensible, we mean that if we receive two
Eucharistic hosts, we do not receive twice as much of Jesus.

Within Christianity, a broad range of views pertaining to the Real Presence
persist. Here is a brief listing of some various non-Catholic views:
1. Eastern Orthodoxy. Eastern Orthodox churches share a similar belief in the
   real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but they do not use the term
   "transubstantiation" and do not explicitly define the manner of the change. 
2. Lutheranism. Lutherans believe in the consubstantiation, where Christ's body
   and blood are present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine.
3. Anglicanism. Anglicans have a wide range of views, from a spiritual presence
   to a corporeal presence (similar to Catholicism), with some emphasizing the
   real presence as a mystery.
4. Reformed/Calvinistic Churches. Reformed Christians, including Presbyterian
   and Reformed Baptist denominations, believe in a real, but spiritual presence
   of Christ in the Eucharist.
5. Methodism. Methodists generally hold a Reformed view, believing in a real,
   spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
6. Anabaptists, Plymouth Brethren, and some non-denominational Christian
   churches. These groups tend to interpret the Eucharist as a symbolic
   remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.

** Scriptural Basis for the Real Presence
Belief in the Real Presence comes from the teachings of Jesus Himself, with
confirmation by St. Paul. Starting with Jesus, He teaches in [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-69&version=ESV][John 6:22-69 (ESV)]]
that He would give believers His flesh and blood to eat and drink. This was an
interactive dialogue, the Greek word Jesus used for "eat" shifts from /phago/
(φάγω) to /trogo/ (τρώγω). Initially, Jesus uses /phago/, the common word for
eating, but then switches to /trogo/, which means to "chew on" or "gnaw on."
This emphasizes the literal nature of consuming his flesh and blood.

When this repulsed His audence, He admitted this was a hard saying. Jesus didn't say
they misunderstood Him, nor did he indicate that He was being symbolic. In fact,
many of His followers left Him over this. Jesus let them go and asked the Twelve
Apostles if they, too, were going to leave Him. Later, at the Last Supper, this
is what Jesus said to His disciples:
#+begin_quote
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave
it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” 

27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink
from it, all of you. 28 For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is
shed for many for the remission of sins.

(Matthew 26:26-28 NKJV)
#+end_quote

#+begin_info
*Figurative, or Literal? Does it even matter?*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>
Some protest that it's not clear whether Christ was being figurative or
literal. It is common to suggest that where the Bible leaves room for
interpretation, the doctrine in question doesn't matter, since it doesn't
pertain to salvation.

There are a few issues with this line of thinking.
1. Christ does not appear to think this issue is insignificant. Jesus would be
   rather uncaring if He allowed most of His disciples to leave Him over an
   issue that didn't matter. He simply could have said, "Come on, guys. You
   don't have to go. It doesn't really matter whether you think I was being
   figurative or literal.  You're abandoning the very source of all life itself
   over a small matter."
2. There is no good mechanism for deciding which issues are central or essential
   to the Christian faith if all you have is personal interpretations according
   to /sola scriptura/. Some Christians think you have to be baptized to be
   save, while others do not; some think drinking alcohol is a grave sin, and
   others do not.

Since Christ Himself appears to believe that it is important for His disciples
to eat His flesh and drink His blood, it should be important to us to determine
whether He is speaking figuratively or literally. Fortunately, /there is/ a way
to do this. To learn more, see the box below, titled *When Interpretations Conflict*.
#+html: </details>
#+end_info


St. Paul's retelling of the Last Supper also says Jesus told His disciples to
eat of His body:
#+begin_quote
23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the
Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; 24 and when He
had given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat; this is My body which is
broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 25 In the same manner He also
took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My
blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” 

26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord’s death till He comes.

(1 Corinthians 11:23-26 NKJV)
#+end_quote

#+begin_note
*When Interpretations Conflict*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>More information ...</summary>

How can a matter be settled when interpretations conflict? A Catholic may read
John 6 and say, "It is clear that this speaks fo the Real Presence in the
Eucharist." On the other hand, a symbolist may say, "No, it isn't that
clear. There is great reason to believe that Jesus is speaking figuratively."

In this case, the dispute is a matter of conflicting interpretations. If
Scripture alone is our ultimate infallible authority, as adherents to the /Sola
Scriptura/ often assert, there is no resolution when two individuals have
conflicting interpretations of the Scriptures. Each man is certain and correct,
because that is what the Holy Spirit spoke to him through the Holy
Scriptures. When interpretations are in direct contradiction, both cannot be
true at the same time according to the logical principle of non-contradiction.

Is there any force that can break the stalemate? If the two parties can suspend
their belief in /Sola Scriptura/ momentarily, they may find that indeed, there
are voices and authorities that can help arbitrate between interpretations: the
early _Church fathers_! Their voices are particularly important because in many
cases, they lived and wrote within living memory of Christ and His
Apostles. Some of them were pupils of the Apostles and Gospel-writers
themselves. Surely they can help us understand, for example, whether St. John
was capturing Christ's Bread of Life Discourse (John 6) as a literal teaching or
as a more figurative parable.

An examplar of this is St. Ignatius of Antioch. He was a pupil of St. John, and
his writings reflect a position well within one camp of the Real-vs-Symbolist
debate to the exclusion of the other. Who better to help us understand whether
St. John intended for us to take Christ's teaching figuratively or literally?
St. Ignatius' testimony is discussed in the next section.

** Testimony of the Church Fathers
After the Scriptures, we have the founders of the Church who uphold the Real
Presence of Christ.

*** The Twelve Apostles

The Twelve Apostles wrote the earliest known catechism for Christians, known as the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didache][Didache]] (the [[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm][text]] is available online for free, and it's pretty short). Each
chapter is roughly a paragraph. At the end of chapter 9, they tel us at the
Eucharist is not ordinary bread, but rather it is sacred. This is found in the
last sentence of chapter 9 of the [[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm][Didache]]:
#+begin_quote
But let no one eat or drink of your Thanksgiving (Eucharist), but they who have
been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has
said, Give not that which is holy to the dogs.
#+end_quote

*** St. Ignatius of Antioch

#+attr_html: :width 300px
#+caption: Ignatius of Antioch is an important voice who helps us understand St. John's intent in writing John 6. Ignatius was a student of John himself. His view can clarify for us whether John meant for us to take John 6 in a literal way or a figurative way.

[[https://www.orthodoxroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ignatius-of-Antioch.jpg]]

The doctrine of the Real Presence also comes with some important historical
evidence. Since John the Evangelist wrote John 6, one of John's students,
Ignatius of Antioch writes clearly about his interpretation of John's work: he
interpret's his teacher's writing in John 6 to be /literal/, not merely
symbolic. Here is what Ignatius writes about the Real Presence:

But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect to the grace of
Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God. They
have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed;
of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.

They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the
Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our
sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore,
who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes.

(Ignatius of Antioch, [[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm][Epistle to the Smyrneans]], Chapters 6-7, 106 AD ([[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm][link]])

In his letter to Christians in Rome, Ignatius wrote:
#+begin_quote
I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I
desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the
flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of
David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is
incorruptible love and eternal life.

(Ignatius of antioch, [[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0107.htm][Epistle to the Romans]], Chapter 7, 110 AD)

Ignatius' view aligns with a literal understanding of the Bread of Life
Discourse. It is natural to conclude that his view aligns with a literal reading
of his mentor's Gospel because that is the view his mentor taught him to
take. Notably, the epistle quoted above was written within 10 years of the death
of his teacher, and within a few decades of the time when St. John wrote the
/Revelation/.

Another important early source is by Justin Martyr ([[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm][First Apology]], chapter
66). Justin writes of the Eucharist:
#+begin_quote
And this food is called among us Εὐχαριστία [the Eucharist], of which no one is
allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are
true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of
sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For
*not as common bread and common drink* do we receive these; but in like manner as
Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both
flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food
which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh
by transmutation are nourished, *is the flesh and blood of that Jesus* who was
made flesh.

** Testimony of the Enemies of Christ

Satanists hate Christ, and they steal the consecrated Eucharist from Catholic
Churches because they, too, believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the
Eucharist. Note that they do not steal bread from Protestant demonmations
because they know that is merely symbolic. Once stolen, Satanists have Black
Mass ceremonies at which they attempt to torture, profane, and desecrate the
Body of Christ.

Below is a video of a recent attempted Black Mass in Topeak, Kanasas. Just prior
to the desecration, a Catholic man intervened and ate the host. It is not fully
known whether the host was consecrated (actually the Eucharist) or
pre-consecrated (only bread). The Satanists claimed that it was not consecrated,
and that the host was procured legally; however, what people say is not always
true.

** TODO The Protestant Reformers and the Real Presence

** Eucharistic Adoration

In Catholicism, we take the Real Presence and transubstantiation to its logical
conclusion. If the consecrated Eucharist is the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity
of Christ, it is Christ Himself. If it is Christ Himself, then He is worthy of
adoration and worship; additionally, it is our privilege to be in the presence
of Christ Himself in the Sacrament of the altar. This is why we decorate our
Tabernacles with gold: to create a dignified resting place for the uncreated
Creator of the universe, Who gives Himself to us. The Eucharist is a symbol that
actually effects what it symbolizes: the Presence of God with us. The Eucharist
is a physical and visible symbol of the truth that our God has drawn near to
us. While the Father and the Holy Spirit have no body, the eternal Son retains
the same divine nature and He has united Himself to a truly human nature in Jesus
Christ. The fact that we can even speak of Him having a Body and Blood is a
consequence of this mysterious union, and the Eucharist makes present this
mystery and this union to us. God has drawn near to us in the incarnation, and
He continues to do so in the Eucharist.

Because of this, consecrated Eucharist provides an intimate and holy devotional
encountner for Christians. On occasions where it is possible, Christ in the Holy
Sacrament of the Altar is placed on an instrument called a *monstrance* so that
His Body is made visible in a dignified way. Faithful Christians are welcomed to
be close to the Sacramental Presence of Christ.

Personally, I find it very fruitful to spend time in prayer before the Blessed
Sacrament (the Eucharist). It is a beautiful, tranquil, and intimate way to pray
with Jesus. In adoration, I can pray various petitions, or I can simply gaze
upon Christ and meditate on the mysteries of Who He is, and the divine love that
led Him to draw near to us.

The following video provides a brief introduction to Eucharistic adoration:
