* Objections

Here, we discuss some objections raised by various groups about Catholicism.

** The Catholic Church Teaches Idolatry

Protestants may feel that the Catholic Church observes and practices idolatry
through either veneration or or prayers to Mary, the angels, and the saints.

There really are two very serious questions here:
1. Is prayer to beings other than God idolatry?
2. Is the respect shown by Catholics to beings other than God idolatry?

Let's discuss these each in turn.

*** Prayer to Beings Other than God

To understand this, we must first understand what prayer is. One perspective
non-Catholics may have is that prayer is communication with God, either
silently, or mentally. Therefore, if someone prays to a being other than God,
the supplicant is in a way deifying that non-divine being.

If that is what Catholics mean by praying to a non-divine being, then, I, too, 
would object, declare it idolatrous, and I would agree that it should be
avoided. However, this is not what Catholics mean in praying to Mary, other
saints, and angels. 

The English word "pray" comes from the Latin /[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precor][precor]]/, which means to beseech,
beg, pray, entreat, supplicate, or request. This term is /broader/ than the
modern English use of "pray." In praying to Mary, other saints, and the angles,
Catholics are asking these individuals to pray for us, in the same way that we
ask another living human being to pray for us. Our prayer to non-divine entities
does not deify them, but simply makes a request of them. What request is that?
Their intercession.

*Modern and Old English Usage of "Pray"*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>

In older English, the term was more widely used to denote a request. For example, in [[https://www.litcharts.com/shakescleare/shakespeare-translations/romeo-and-juliet/act-4-scene-3#:~:text=But%2C%20gentle%20Nurse%2C%20I%20pray,cross%20and%20full%20of%20sin.][Act 4, Scene 3]] of
Shakespeare's /Romeo and Juliet/, Juliet asks her nurse to leave her alone:
#+begin_quote
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself tonight,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.
#+end_quote
Although Juliet uses the word "pray," she is in no way deifying her nurse, nor
committing idolatry.

"Pray" also is [[https://www.lsd.law/define/pray][used in courtrooms]] with this more archaic sense as a formal,
legal request.

#+end_comment

The next natural question is whether it is valid to make requests for
intercession of holy, deceased individuals in heaven. Some say that there is no
scriptural precedent for this, so it should not be practiced.

*** Veneration of Mary and the Saints

Catholics hold St. Mary, the other saints, and the angels in high regard. Is
this veneration idolatrous?

To understand this, we must understand what idolatry is and how Catholics relate
to these non-divine beings.

Idolatry may be defined as worship of another being aside from God. More
practically, it can be understood as the love of a material or created good more
than we love God. There are many material goods we make into idols, but the
often reduce to one of four things: power, pleasure, honor, or wealth. We will
deal here mostly with the worship of beings other than God, though enslavement
to other idols is a concern and separate topic initself.

The Catholic understanding of God is that God defines in a category by
Himself. He is infinite, immaterial, and eternal. He is without cause, and we
say God is being itself. There is no existence apart from God. Since God is
immaterial, He has no physical body and is not constrained by the material
universe, and so no image can be made of Him. God is being itself, and, within
Christian revelation, God is three Persons who share in the Divine nature: God
the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Yet, the eternal God has made an
image of Himself for us: Jesus Christ, in which this Divine Person has united a
human nature to His Divine nature in a mysterious way. He fully shares in
Divinity and its eternal nature, and He fully shares in a human nature. It is
possilbe to say that Jesus Christ is eternal in His divine nature, although His
human nature had a beginning and thus is not eternal.

#+begin_info
*More about God and His Nature*

For more information about the divne nature, see the [[https://enriquepacis.github.io/ExploringCatholicism/#what-is-god][What is God?]] and  [[https://enriquepacis.github.io/ExploringCatholicism/#god-is-being][God does
NOT exist!]] info boxes.
#+end_info

Apart from God, there is no one who is eternal. The angels were created by God,
and so they are in no way equal to God. Even Satan himself is a created being,
and he exists because God wills his existence. Not even St. Mary herself
partakes of the eternal and divine nature. St. Mary had a beginning, and so she
is not eternal. Mary does not share in the divine nature.

With a proper understanding of God's divine nature--to the extent that we can
understand it-- and an understanding of the relationship between this divine
nature and the human nature (or the angelic nature, for that matter), it becomes
impossible to think of any created being as an entity on par with, much less
greater than God. Thus, it becomes impossible to venerate a created being in any
way that rivals our veneration and worship of God.

In fact, Catholics do not worship anyone or anything apart from God. In
Catholicism, /worship/ requires sacrifice, and the highest sacrifice is the very
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ (the Eucharist). Thus, the Catholic Mass (or
Orthodox Divine Liturgies) are the ultimate Sacrifice of God to God. Orthodox or
apostolic Christians--including Catholics--offer the Mass to no one other than
God. St. Mary is *not* worthy of the Sacrifice of the Mass. Thus, we worship God
alone.

In Catholic teaching, we give only God the fullest honor and worship. This is
called latria, the supreme worship allowed to God alone. After God the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we allow ourselves to /reverence/ other created
beings. Thing of this as honor, such as is due a king or a ruler or some other
dignitary. Such honor is referred to as dulia, and this encapsulates reverence
that we show to St. Mary, the angels, and the saints. In fact, Catholics
recognize St. Mary as the pinnacle of the created order, and we give her not
latria, but an extreme form of dulia, called hyperdulia.

** TODO The Teachings and Traditions of the Catholic Church Cannot be Trusted

The burden of proof is on him or her who claims this. They must show which false
teachings were invented by the Catholic Church, and when.

This is a problem for /sola scriptura/ Christians. If the teachings and the
traditions of the Catholic Church are unreliable, then how can they be sure of
the Bible? The list of books included in the Bible was established by
tradition. Notably, the Canon 24 of the [[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3816.htm][Council of Carthage (419 AD)]] list the
books of the Bible, stating that only these books are to be considered as
Canonical Scripture, and that only these books are to be read in church. This
list was preserved under the oral tradition of the Church: "besides the
Canonical Scriptures nothing be read in church under the name of divine
Scripture.
#+begin_quote
But the Canonical Scriptures are as follows: ... for these are the things which 
we have received from our fathers to be read in church."
#+end_quote


** TODO The Catholic Church is Corrupt

** TODO The Catholic Church has Changed Doctrines

Some say that the way the Catholic Church has changed doctrines indicates that
this is not the original church that Christ founded. They have changed--and in
some cases--corrupted original doctrines.

Some interesting examples that have been brought up to me include:
1. *Confession*. The note below gives a brief history of Confession--also known as
   the Sacrament of Reconcilliation--within the Catholic Church. The notable
   changes in the practice of Confession is cited as a way in which the Catholic
   Church has been unfaithful to the original teachings of the Scripture, and
   therefore has invalidated Herself as the Church which Christ has founded.

   #+begin_info
   *A Brief History of Confession in Catholicism*

   #+html: <details>
   #+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>

   The practice of confession—also known as the Sacrament of Penance or
   Reconciliation—has undergone several significant changes throughout the
   history of the Catholic Church. Here's a broad historical overview:

   - Early Church (1st–3rd centuries)
     - *Public Confession*: Serious sins (apostasy, murder, adultery) were
       confessed **publicly** before the Christian community.
     - *Once-in-a-lifetime Penance*: Penance was *long and harsh*, often lasting
       months or years, and usually allowed *only once* after Baptism.
     - *Reconciliation*: After completing the penance, the sinner was formally
       reconciled by the bishop, often during Holy Week.
   - Post-Constantinian Era (4th–6th centuries)
     - As Christianity gained legal status, **public penance** continued but
       began to soften in practice.
     - The *bishop* played a key role in reconciliation.
     - *Private spiritual direction* emerged, but public confession remained
       standard for grave sins.
   - Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Influence (6th–9th centuries)
     - Monastic practice in Ireland and Britain introduced *private
       confession* to a priest or abbot.
     - *Frequent confession** became more common.
     - Penances were assigned using *penitential books* listing sins and
       appropriate penances. 
     - This model spread to continental Europe through missionaries.
   - Medieval Period (9th–13th centuries)
     - The *Fourth Lateran Council (1215)* mandated **annual confession** for all Catholics (the "Easter Duty").
     - Confession became **private, auricular**, and often **anonymous**.
     - The *seal of confession* (absolute secrecy) was firmly established.
     - Emphasis on the *three acts of the penitent*:
       - Contrition
       - Confession
       - Satisfaction
   - Council of Trent & Counter-Reformation (1545–1563)
     - Reaffirmed the necessity of *confession to a priest* for forgiveness of
       mortal sins.
     - Stressed **sacramental grace** and the priest’s role in *absolution*. 
     - Promoted regular, devout confession as part of Catholic life.
   - Modern Period (19th–20th centuries)
     - Popes like *Pius X* encouraged *frequent confession* and *frequent Communion*.
     - *Confessionals* became standard in churches for privacy.
     - Catechesis began to emphasize a *personal relationship with God* and
       *interior conversion*.
   - Post-Vatican II Era (1960s–present)
     - *Vatican II* highlighted the *communal and healing* aspects of the
       sacrament.
     - Introduced *three forms* of the *Rite of Penance*:
       - Individual confession and absolution (ordinary form).
       - Communal celebration with individual confession and absolution.
       - General absolution in emergencies (e.g., war, disaster).
       - *Decline in regular practice* observed in many areas, though
         *renewals* occur seasonally and in youth movements.

2. *A Celibate Priesthood*
   One argument against the validity of the is suggests that the Catholic Church
   mandates celibacy for its priesthood, and this is contrary to the Scriptural
   allowances for church leaders to be married and have children. We can borrow
   text stating this argument:
   #+begin_quote
   In 1 Timothy 3:1-13 and Titus 1:6-9, the Apostle Paul seems to assume that
   elders, bishops, overseers, and deacons will be married. Notice the phrases
   “the husband of one wife” (1 Timothy 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6), “he must manage his
   own family well” (1 Timothy 3:4,12), and “his children obey him with proper
   respect” (1 Timothy 3:4; Titus 1:6). On a related issue, please read our
   article on whether these Scripture mean that a church leader must be married
   and have children. While these Scriptures are not a requirement for church
   leaders to be married, they most definitely present an allowance for church
   leaders to be married. It is therefore anti-biblical for any church to
   require celibacy of its leaders. 

   Why, then, does the Roman Catholic Church (and a few other Christian
   denominations) require celibacy of priests/church leaders? (/source:
   [[https://www.gotquestions.org/celibacy-priests.html][gotquestions.org]]/)
   #+end_quote

   There are two fallacies in the above quote, which we may readily point out:
   1. The Catholic Church actually allows does not require celibacy of all
      priests. For example, priests within the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches][Eastern Rite]] may be married,
      which is similar to Orthodox or Oriental churches outside of the Catholic
      Church. Think of a rite as something similar to a Protestant
      denomination. A rite upholds the authority of the Pope as well as Catholic 
      dogmas, but it may vary in terms of disciplines, such as whether priests
      may be married, or which form of the Mass is used. The Latin Rite (also
      known as the Roman Rite) is the most well-known rite in America, and
      indeed, Canon 277 in [[https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib2-cann208-329_en.html#CHAPTER_III.][Book II, Title III, Chapter III]] of the Code of Canon
      Law governing the Roman rite calls 
      for celibacy among clerics: 
      #+begin_quote
      Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the
      sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is
      a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to
      Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more
      freely to the service of God and humanity. 
      #+end_quote
      Even within the Roman Rite, there are exceptions. The Pastoral Provision
      of 1980 by Pope St. John Paul II allows for former non-Catholic priests
      who convert to Catholicism to become priests, even if previously married
      with children.

   2. There is no Scriptural prohibition preventing the Catholic Church from
      exercising its authority requiring celibacy for its clerics in most
      cases. Clerical celibacy mirors Christ's full dedication to the Church.

*What Catholic Teachings and Practices Can Change Over Time?*
#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>

We find it helpful to borrow and insert an excerpt from David Currie's book,
[[https://www.amazon.com/Born-Fundamentalist-Again-Catholic/dp/089870569X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=N6DKLQ0CZQTV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vDX3wDEgULuN8bgk8-pDtJaFRGshOT8g26SOSPOvjBmkArH1D-Zi_AyPp9cHH9EQ3rdoCrcPV7SljGS6TuNiVmGmHYm1EYaN29p4XFuCIXUtyyEa-etTcfCdPqFkQepI.mzbqSSA2JLUd9uzJquDieZCGhLfgkDJHtfTAryaPI8E&dib_tag=se&keywords=born+fundamentalist+born+again+catholic+by+david+currie&qid=1746584011&sprefix=David+Currie+Born%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1][Born Evangelical, Born Again Catholic]]. Here, Currie addresses the question of
*changing doctrines* in the Catholic church. Currie helpfully distinguishes
between types of doctrinal changes, and he categorizes Catholic teachings and
practices into five categores, which we abbreviate as /Deposit/, /Dogma/,
/Doctrine/, /Discipline/, and /Devotion/. I can do no better than to let Currie
speak for himself here:
#+begin_quote
Change has occurred and will continue to occur. This was an important issue to
me because I felt that no organization could be the true church if it
contradicted itself on essential doctrines over time. I spent quite a bit of 
time thinking this over. Here are my observations.

Since change is a very general term, let us separate it into two parts. There is
a change that expands on prior truths without negating them, which I will call
“development”. This type of change “unpacks” meaning inherent in the original
truth so that the truth can be understood better. It defines. The other type of
change reverses that which has been accepted originally. I will call that type
“contradiction”. Contradiction affirms one day that “A” is true, and the next
insists that “non-A” is true.

There is one other distinction we must make. In thinking through this issue for
my own edification, I came to see that the information of the church could be
divided into at least five categories: deposit, dogma, doctrine, discipline, and
devotion. I devised these categories for my own thinking, so I suppose the
alliteration proves that I once studied homiletics. These are not the categories
of the church herself, but merely distinctions that helped me clarify the idea
of change.

*Deposit* is that body of truth originally given to the apostles. In time, some of
it was written into Scripture, while some of it remained in its original form of
oral tradition. Protecting this deposit is a major responsibility of the
bishops. The church teaches that nothing can be added to or contradicted within
the deposit. For example, Peter had no authority to make up a new story about
Jesus healing someone. General revelation ended with the death of John, the last
apostle. The goal regarding the deposit is simply to conserve it with no change
whatsoever. As an evangelical, I was surprised at how seriously Catholics
regarded this responsibility.

*Dogma* is that body of truth that has been affirmed by the councils of the
church and the Holy See of Rome. The further explanation, definition, and
development of the concepts within the deposit, as well as the deposit itself,
are contained within dogma. Once dogma is declared by the bishops, it can be
further developed but never contradicted by future doctrine or dogma. I could
find no case within Vatican II where earlier dogma was contradicted. Dogma is
usually declared in Council or by the Pope to combat a particular problem. For
example, the dogma regarding the divinity of Christ was not declared by counsel
until teachers in the early church questioned that truth of the deposit. The
deposit always contained the truths of Christ’s divinity, however. The Council
of Nicaea certainly did not invent new truth about Christ’s nature as
God-man. They merely clarified the truth already believed. So, dogma can be
developed.

*Doctrine* is the development of truth on the basis of the deposit and
dogma. Doctrine can develop and even contradict itself over time because it is
largely the thoughts of people. It has not been officially declared true or
false by the church. This is the realm in which most theologians deal, on the
cutting edge of the Church’s thinking. One Catholic theologian may totally
contradict another equally Catholic theologian. They both can’t be right, yet
the church is withholding her judgment on that particular issue. More thought,
more wisdom, or more time may be needed before the church decides which
formulation of that particular doctrine is fully consistent with the deposit and
dogma. Doctrine pushes the envelope of the Church as far and is only slowly if
ever, accepted as dogma.

Otherwise good, careful evangelical scholars make the mistake of taking doctrine
as the unchangeable teaching of the Church. When they see it changing over time,
they draw the wrong conclusions. The reason is relatively simple. The ultimate
authority in most evangelical churches of what is truly biblical rests with
those men teaching at the seminary from which that church draws its pastors. If
the pastor and board get into a theological tussle over some issue, it is not
unusual for a seminary professor to be called in to moderate and to decide the
truth in question. As a result, when these same evangelical scholars attempt to
understand what is really going on inside the Catholic Church, they make the
mistake of looking to their counterparts in the Catholic seminaries as the
authorities on Catholic theology. 

It seems that every evangelical pastor has at least one anti-Catholic book in
his study. When I informed my pastor of my intentions, he lent me a book written
by a professor at TEDS who is now at another institution. This truly fine
scholar stumbled rather dramatically in his research because he made precisely
the mistake of considering professors as the authorities. In the Catholic Church
the professor is not the final arbiter of truth; the bishops and the Pope
are. The church’s pronouncements are very accessible, but most evangelicals
don’t ever read these documents, much less footnote the, in their discussions of
what Catholics teach. You do not know what Catholics teach unless you go to the
sources that they themselves accept as authoritative. 

*Disciplines* are those rules that govern the everyday life of faithful
Catholics. This area has seen the most change (contradiction) in our generation,
and it is this very visible area that people usually point to when they accuse
the church of having changed since Vatican II. For example, in the past,
Catholics were required to fast on the Ember Days, 12 days each year. They are
no longer required to do this.

This is a bitter pill for evangelicals to swallow, but disciplines are supposed
to be mandatory once in force, yet some of them may be changed over time. It
would have been wrong for a Catholic to ignore the Ember Days fast in the
1950s. Yet now it is no longer necessary to fast on the former Ember Days
(except Good Friday) because this discipline has been rescinded. Why?  It has to
do with obedience.

As Christians, we are under the authority of the apostles’ successors, the
bishops. They are responsible for making rules that will enhance the spiritual
life of their flock. Although that goal never changes, the rules of discipline
may. When the bishops decide an existing rule is no longer effective in helping
people worship God, or when they determine that a new rule would be effective,
it is a Catholics duty to obey them. This is certainly in line with the promise:
“Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth will be loosed in heaven.” Disciplines by their very nature are going to
be developed and contradicted over time — bound when the need arises and loosed
when appropriate.

*Devotions* are the most personal of these five categories. Devotions are those 
activities by which an individual Christian may enhance his walk with God. The
Catholic use of “devotion” is much broader than the evangelical use of the
word. It means much more than Bible study and prayer. Devotions are never
mandatory for a Catholic layman, although they may be approved and are highly
recommended. History illustrates that devotions develop over time. One
well-known example of a devotion is the Rosary. I remember being relieved to
learn that a practicing Catholic could choose never to say the Rosary and still
be a good Catholic. A priest friend helped me understand that Christ and his
sacrificial death are at the very center of Catholic worship. The Rosary is only
about eight centuries old. Most Catholics, however, wonder why anyone would
choose not to speak with Mary. As a devotion, the Rosary is approved by the
church, but it is never mandated. Devotions can develop.

** The Catholic Church as is a Bloated, Unscriptural Bureaucracy

Some critics of the Catholic Church claim that it is an organization that looks
unlike the early church of the Bible. It is a behemoth of an organization with
a structure not described in the Scriptures.

This criticism suffers from many flaws:
1. Underlying this claim is another claim: that all valid Christian practices
   and beliefs must be explicitly found in the Bible. The great irony here is
   that this claim does not pass its own test: it is found nowhere in the Bible
   that a belief or practice must be found in the Bible.
2. The seed of the present-day ecclesial structure *is* in fact found in the
   Bible. See the discussion box below for more details.

#+begin_info
*Scriptural Origins of Ecclesial Structure*
   
#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>
    
The modern Catholic ecclesial structure—composed primarily of *bishops*,
*priests*, and *deacons* —-has both Scriptural roots and historical
development. The New Testament lays the foundation for this threefold
ministry, which the Catholic Church understands as being instituted by Christ
and developed under the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the early Church. 

Below is a breakdown of Scriptural support for each of these offices:

- *Bishops* (Greek: ἐπίσκοπος – episkopos, "overseer")
  - Scriptural references
    - Acts 1:20 – Peter interprets Psalm 109:8 to establish a replacement for
      Judas: “His office let another take.” The Greek word used is episkopē.
    - Acts 20:28 – Paul tells the elders of Ephesus:
      #+begin_quote
      “Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the Holy
      Spirit has made you overseers (episkopoi), to shepherd the church of
      God.” 
      #+end_quote
    - 1 Timothy 3:1–7 – Paul describes the qualities of a bishop/overseer
      (episkopos):
      #+begin_quote
      “If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task...”
      #+end_quote
    - *Early Church understanding*:
      - The terms presbyter (elder) and episkopos (overseer) were used somewhat
        interchangeably early on, but by the 2nd century (cf. St. Ignatius of
        Antioch, still very early in the second century), a clearer distinction
        was made between bishops and presbyters (priests).

- *Priests* (Greek: πρεσβύτερος – /presbyteros/, "elder")
  - Scriptural References:
    - Acts 14:23 – Paul and Barnabas appoint elders (presbyteroi) in each
      church:
      #+begin_quote
      “And when they had appointed elders for them in every church...”
      #+end_quote
    - 1 Timothy 5:17 –
      #+begin_quote
      “Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,
      especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.”
      #+end_quote
    - James 5:14 –
      #+begin_quote
      “Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and
      let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
      Lord.”
      #+end_quote
  - Note: The term /presbyteros/ evolved into the English word “priest”,
    particularly as it passed through Latin (presbyter). In Catholic
    theology, presbyters share in the bishop’s priesthood and are primarily
    responsible for the sacraments and preaching in local communities.
- *Deacons* (Greek: διάκονος – diakonos, "servant" or "minister")
  - Scriptural References:
    - Acts 6:1–6 – Seven men (including Stephen and Philip) are appointed to
      serve tables so the apostles can focus on prayer and the Word. While
      not called "deacons" here, this is traditionally seen as the origin of
      the diaconate.
    - Philippians 1:1 – Paul addresses:
      #+begin_quote
      “To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the
      bishops (episkopoi) and deacons (diakonoi).”
