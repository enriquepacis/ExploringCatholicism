26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city
of Galilee named Nazareth,
27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house
of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.
28 And having come in, the angel said to her, ``Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!''

29 But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and
considered what manner of greeting this was.
30 Then the angel said to her, ``Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
found favor with God. 
31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son,
and shall call His name Jesus. 
32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and
the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
33 And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.''

34 Then Mary said to the angel, ``How can this be, since I do not know a man?''

35 And the angel answered and said to her, ``The Holy Spirit will come
upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you;
therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the
Son of God.
36 Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her
old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called
barren.
37 For with God nothing will be impossible.''

38 Then Mary said, ``Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to
me according to your word.'' And the angel departed from her.

39 Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with
haste, to a city of Judah, 40 and entered the house of Zacharias and
greeted Elizabeth. 41 And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the
greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 Then she spoke out with a loud voice
and said, ``Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
your womb! 43 But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me? 44 For indeed, as soon as the voice of your
greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 45
Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of
those things which were told her from the Lord.''

46 And Mary said:

``My soul magnifies the Lord,
47 And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
48 For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;
For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.
49 For He who is mighty has done great things for me,
And holy is His name.
50 And His mercy is on those who fear Him
From generation to generation.
51 He has shown strength with His arm;
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
52 He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
And exalted the lowly.
53 He has filled the hungry with good things,
And the rich He has sent away empty.
54 He has helped His servant Israel,
In remembrance of His mercy,
55 As He spoke to our fathers,
To Abraham and to his seed forever.''
56 And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.

And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. 3 So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.

4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child. 6 So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. 7 And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

*8 Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the
fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.
9 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone 
around them, and they were greatly afraid.
10 Then the angel said to them, ``Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. 
11 For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 
12 And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.''

13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:

14 ``Glory to God in the highest,
And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!''
15 So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven,
that the shepherds said to one another, ``Let us now go to Bethlehem
and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made
known to us.''
16 And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph,
and the Babe lying in a manger.
17 Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
18 And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
20 Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.*

21 And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22 Now when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, ``Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord''),
24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, ``A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.''

25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and
this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel,
and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
26 And it had been revealed to him
by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the
Lord’s Christ.
27 So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when
the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the
custom of the law,
28 he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and
said:

29 ``Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace,
According to Your word;
30 For my eyes have seen Your salvation
31 Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,
32 A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles,
And the glory of Your people Israel.''
33 And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were
spoken of Him.
34 Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His
mother, ``Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of
many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against
35 (yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of
many hearts may be revealed.''

36 Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a
husband seven years from her virginity;
37 and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but
served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
38 And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all
those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

*** The Finding of Our Lord in the Temple (Luke 2:41-52)

#+begin_quote
41 His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the
Passover. 42 And when He was twelve years old, they went up to
Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. 43 When they had
finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in
Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; 44 but supposing
Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought
Him among their relatives and acquaintances. 45 So when they did not
find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. 46 Now so it was
that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the
midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them
questions. 47 And all who heard Him were astonished at His
understanding and answers. 48 So when they saw Him, they were amazed;
and His mother said to Him, ``Son, why have You done this to us? Look,
Your father and I have sought You anxiously.''

49 And He said to them, “Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I
must be about My Father’s business?” 50 But they did not understand
the statement which He spoke to them.

51 Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was
subject to them, but His mother kept all these things in her
heart. 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
God and men.
