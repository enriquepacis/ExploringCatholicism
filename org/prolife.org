* Pro-Life

Catholics are pro-life because God is pro-life. Divine revelation tells us that
the /imago dei/ (image of God) is stamped on every human being. This means that
each person has infinite dignity. Furthermore, we believe that the shedding of
innocent blood is /always/ wrong. There is no more innocent person than a baby,
especially a baby in the womb who has not done any wrong. Therefore, babies in
the womb are the most innocent among us, and they are the most vulnerable. To
kill these defenseless people is always wrong.
