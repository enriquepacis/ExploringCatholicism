* Pro-Life

Catholics are pro-life because God is pro-life. Divine revelation tells us that
the /imago dei/ (image of God) is stamped on every human being. This means that
each person has infinite dignity. Furthermore, we believe that the shedding of
innocent blood is /always/ wrong. There is no more innocent person than a baby,
especially a baby in the womb who has not done any wrong. Therefore, babies in
the womb are the most innocent among us, and they are the most vulnerable. To
kill these defenseless people is always wrong.

** TODO Exceptions for Rape and Incest

Some concerns arise over the mental health of a mother of a baby conceived
through sexual assault. Proponents of a rape/incest exemption for abortion
suggest that to bear and raise the child will be a constant reminder to the
mother of her abuse. Nonetheless, assault survivors sometimes choose life for
their babies, and they can and do find great healing. The inseparable bond
between mother and baby in fact can bring great healing to a suvivor of sexual
assault or abuse. This video interview features Jennifer Christie is a rape survivor who chose
life for her son.

Ryan Bomberger was conceived in rape, but his mother chose life for him. She
then gave Ryan for adoption. Now married, Ryan and his wife give their life to
help women in crisis preganancies.

Abortion leads to other health concerns, both mental and physical. First,
abortion always is traumatic. A mother is placed in an unnatural position--under
emotional duress--of choosing between life and death for her baby. My own
personal friends who work in the pro-life space have said that survivors of
sexual abuse and assault who choose to kill their baby never get over it: they
have killed their own baby, and it's a choice that cannot be undone.

Health concerns also arise. Namely, there is a link between abortion and breast
cancer. For example, a [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16526417/][review article]] by Kitchen, Rivedi, and Mokbel points to a
link, and the abstract to their article reads:
#+begin_quote
The hormonal changes that take place in pregnancy cause breast tissue to
proliferate and differentiate. Abortion interrupts this process and may leave
the proliferated, undifferentiated breast tissue at higher risk of
carcinogenesis. This review explains the supposed difference in effects of
induced and spontaneous abortion upon the breast tissue and examines the
literature for a link with breast cancer. Additional subcategories examined
include parity, number of abortions, gestation, and maternal age at abortion. A
comparison of retrospective and prospective studies is made and possible sources
of bias are identified. There is no evidence to support a link between
spontaneous abortion and breast cancer. Absence of a link with induced abortion
is less clear, and further research should concentrate on investigating any
relationship. 
#+end_quote
Nonetheless, the American Cancer Society (ACS) claims that
[[https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html][there is no link between abortion and breast cancer]]. Could this be true, or
could it be possible that abortion is so profitable that some stakeholders would
seek to suppress information about the link between abortion and breast cancer
and manipulate the narrative propagated by the US Government and the mainstream
media?

*Big Tech is Honest, Fair, and Balanced*

In May 2018, Irish voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to repeal the
Eighth Amendment, which effectively banned abortion in Ireland except in cases
where the mother's life was at risk. The amendment was introduced in 1983 and
had been a significant point of contention for decades. The 2018 referendum
passed with 66.4% of voters in favor, leading to the legalization of abortion
during the first trimester of pregnancy.   

But manipulation by big tech may have played a role here. Leading up to the
referrendum vote in 2018, Google banned [[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44055077][Google banned abortion poll adds]] in
Ireland. Proponents of the Eighth Ammendment claim that the ban favored
pro-abortion groups and disproportionately hurt the pro-life cause ([[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44067607][link]]),
eventually leading the Eight Ammendment to be overturned. This led to widespread
abortion access in Ireland, and a new market for the abortion industry.

But, Big Tech fair and balanced, right? They would never try to suppress
information, nor manipulate the masses, nor influence a vote, right?
... Right?!?

** TODO To Save the Mother's Life

It is a myth promoted by pro-abortionists that abortion may be required to save
the life of the mother under rare circumstances. The US Conference of Catholic
Bishops has published an infographic ([[https://www.usccb.org/resources/Women's%20Healt%20Infographic.pdf][pdf]]) to help combat such myths. This includes
some facts:
1. *Abortion does not save women’s lives*.
   1. *Abortion* is the *direct* and *intentional* killing of a child in the womb.
   2. *Abortion is never medically necessary*. It does not treat or solve any
      pregnancy-related complication.
2. Outlawing abortion will not affect treatment for miscarriage.
3. Women can get the lifesaving treatments they need—without abortion.
   
Please see the [[https://www.usccb.org/resources/Women's%20Healt%20Infographic.pdf][infographic]] for more information. For still more information,

*A Maternal Sacrifice*

#+html: <details>
#+html: <summary>Read more ...</summary>


One heroic mother is St. Gianna Beretta Molla. She was diagnosed with a uterine
tumor while pregnant with her fourth child. A [[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint/gianna-beretta-molla-741][Catholic News Agency article]]
reads,
#+begin_quote
The doctors gave her three choices: an abortion, which would save her life and
allow her to have more children but take the life of her baby; a complete
hysterectomy, which would save her life but prevent her from having more
children and take her baby’s life; or removal of the fibroma only, which posed
the risk of future complications but could save the life of her baby. 

Gianna chose to have only the tumor removed. She was willing to lose her life
for the sake of her baby’s. She knew that she may not make it through delivery,
but she made it very clear that if a choice needed to be made between saving her
own life or the child’s, the child needed to be saved. 

Throughout her pregnancy, Gianna found strength in the Lord and asked him to
take any pain away from the child. 

On April 21, 1962 Gianna Emmanuel Molla was successfully delivered by Cesarean
section. However, after complications arose with the tumor, Gianna passed away 7
days later on April 28. 

Gianna was beatified by Saint Pope John Paul II on April 24, 1994 and canonized
as a saint on May 16, 2004. Her husband and children attended her canonization.

Other valiant, heroic, and saintly mothers have made similar choices. We covet
their prayers!

*** TODO Double-effect versus Utilitarianism

The principle of double effect allows actions that cause harm as a side effect,
provided the harm is not intended, and the overall action is morally
permissible. "The ends justify the means" suggests that any means, even immoral
ones, are justifiable if they lead to a desirable outcome. The key difference
lies in the intention behind the harmful effect. The principle of double effect
only permits harm if it's not intended, while "the ends justify the means"
justifies any means, regardless of intent.

- Principle of Double Effect
  - Focus: This principle focuses on the intended and unintended consequences of
    actions.
  - Permissibility: It states that an action is permissible even if it causes a
    harmful side effect, as long as the harmful effect is not intended.
  - Conditions:
    - For the principle to apply, the following conditions must be met:
      - The act itself must be good or at least morally neutral.
      - The intended good effect must not be achieved by means of the evil
        effect. 
      - The evil effect must not be intended, but merely foreseen.
      - The evil effect must not be disproportionate to the good effect.
- "The Ends Justify the Means":
  - Focus: This phrase emphasizes the outcome or end goal of an action and
    justifies the means used to achieve that goal.
  - Justification: It suggests that any action, even morally wrong ones, can be
    justified if they lead to a desirable outcome.
  - Validity
    - This phrase is often criticized because it can lead to a justification of
      any means, regardless of their moral implications
- Compare and Contrast
  - The core distinction lies in the importance of intention.
    - The principle of
      double effect considers the intention behind the action, emphasizing that
      harm must be a side effect, not a means to the intended good.
    - In contrast, utilitarianism disregards intention and focuses solely on the 
      outcome, potentially justifying actions that are inherently immoral.
    - The double effect principle is more nuanced and allows for morally
      permissible actions that have unintended harmful side effects, while utilitarianism
      can be used to justify any means, regardless of their moral implications.
  
** Birth Control, Abortion, and the Sexual Revolution

The decadence and permissivity of today's sexually-permissive culture can be
traced to the sexual revolution of the 1960s. The sexual revolution can be
traced back to birth control and practices contrary to natural law.

The Catholic Church uses natural law in addition to tradition and scripture to
determine morality. Indeed, the morality of various sexual acts can be derived
from natural law.

Natural law is a body of unchanging moral principles regarded as a basis for all
human conduct. When applied to the marital act, natural law looks to the
function and design of the human body. The marital act is known to have a
two-fold purpose: a *reproductive* function, in which the human race is
propagated; and a *unitive* function, in which a husband and wife form and express
an intimate bond that is ordered toward love for one another and children that
come from this union.  Since these two functions are part of the marital act,
any practice that seeks to subvert, suppress, or defeat one function is illicit
and immoral according to natural law.

For example, contraceptive acts that seek to suppress the reproductive aspect
leave make the marital act all about pleasure. In this case, the partners tend
to use one another for pleasure and seek to avoid the potential for parental
responsibilities that come with the possibility of children conceived during the
act. Additionally, other acts that cannot produce new life but involve sexual
intimacy are illicit and immoral according to natural law, such as
self-pleasure and same-sex intimate relations. 

On the other hand, acts that focus on reproduction without spousal intimacy
(think /in vitro/ fertalization, surrogate motherhood, etc.) also are immoral
and illicit per natural law. In these cases, children are brought into the
world apart from a natural and intimate relationship between a mother and
father. Every child has a right to a mother and a father, and such artificial
acts deprive the child of one or both of these rights.

Notably, the 1968 papal encyclical [[https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html][/Humanae Vitae/]], Pope Paul VI predicted that
the widespread use of contraception would lead to negative consequences,
including a decline in moral standards, marital infidelity, and a loss of
respect for women. For more information on this, see also:
