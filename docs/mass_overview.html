<p>
Understanding the Eucharist&#x2013;that is, the elements of Communion&#x2013;is perhaps the
most important key to understanding the Catholic Mass and the Catholic
worldview. Common among the orthodox Christians is that Jesus Christ is truly
present in the elements of Communion, called the Eucharist in the Catholic
Church. By <i>orthodox Christians</i>, we mean the Christian churches established
throughout the centuries <i>prior</i> to the Protestant Reformation, such as the
Armenians, the Copts, the Greek Orthodox, the Russian Orthodox, etc.
</p>

<p>
Tthe belief that Jesus Christ is truly present in the elements of the
Eucharist. This concept also is referred to the <i>Real Presence</i> of Christ in the
Eucharist, and the specific version of the Real Presence taught by the Catholic
church involves <i>transubstantiation</i>.
</p>

<p>
Transubstantiation means that what looks like bread is God. At some point, it
was made as bread. It has all the outward appearances (technically, called the
<i>accidents</i>) of bread, and in its essence or <i>substance</i>, it is bread. However,
at the words of consecration ("This is my body" or "This is the cup of my
blood"), bread and wine are changed in substance from bread and wine to the very
flesh and blood of God.
</p>

<p>
For orthodox Christians, this means that being in the presence of the Eucharist
is a very holy occasion, since it is the very presence of Jesus Christ, the
living God. This makes such occasions every bit as holy as the encounter Moses
had with the burning bush:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the
mountain of God. 2 And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire
from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with
fire, but the bush was not consumed. 3 Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside
and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.” 
</p>

<p>
4 So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the
midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” 
</p>

<p>
And he said, “Here I am.”
</p>

<p>
5 Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet,
for the place where you stand is holy ground.” 6 Moreover He said, “I am the God
of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

<h3 id="org9cc94b0"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> The Mass as an Intimate Dance with God</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Because of the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the Mass provides a real
and intimate way for us to have contact with our Lord. I like to think of it as
an intimate dance with the Divine, or perhaps as a call and response between a
Divne lover, and me, His beloved.
</p>

<p>
The Mass can be divided roughly into two parts: the liturgy of the Word, and the
liturgy of the Eucharist. We can think of the liturgy of the Word as God's
divine call to us, and the liturgy of the Eucharist as our human response to
God's call.
</p>

<p>
The liturgy of the Word  contains the introductory rites and readings of
Scripture. It culminates with a reading from the Gospel, for which we stand in
honor of Jesus, acknowledging His presence (non-Eucharistic) in the reading of
the Gospels (the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The 
ligurgy of the Word then typically concludes 
with a homily, in which the priest helps us connect the readings with our
present lives and draws on how we may apply the Word of God personally
today. Depending on the day of the week or the liturgical calendar, there may be
a profession of the Nicene creed. This completes the divine call in the Liturgy
of the Word.
</p>

<div class="note" id="orged927bc">
<p>
Christians consider the Scriptures to be the divinely-inspired Word of God in written form. Here, when
you see <i>Word</i>, think <i>revelation</i> of God. The fullest revelation of God is Jesus Christ, God in human form. See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A1-3&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>
</p>

</div>

<p>
After the homily, we transition to the liturgy of the Eucharist. The climax of
the liturgy of the Eucharist is when the priest consecrates the bread and wine,
transforming it to the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, followed by the personal
reception of the Body and Blood by the Catholic faithful. When receiving the
Eucharist, we are declaring with our actions that we believe in all the
teachings of the Catholic Church, and we are offering ourselves to God, just as
He offers Himself to us in the Eucharist. We highlight several
parts of the liturgy of the Eucharist::
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It may begin with a period of <i>intercession</i>, where the church prays together
for various needs.</li>
<li>Then, there will be an offering of the people (an offering collection plate
or basket is passed around), and the bread and wine that will become the Body
and Blood of Jesus at the <i>Consecration</i>.  The bread and wine also are
regarded as <i>gifts</i> from the faithful</li>
<li>The priest then prepares the gifts to serve as the offering. He says prayers
for himself and the people and the church.</li>
<li>Finally, when the altar is prepared, the priest invites us to pray with him
for what will become a sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood in Eucharistic
form to God. We stand and respond in prayer, finally concluding with "Holy,
Holy, Holy, is the Lord God almighty. Heaven and earth are full of Your
glory. Hosana in the highest. Hosana in the highest." Then, we kneel as the
priest undrtakes the holiest part of the Mass, the Consecration of the gifts.</li>
<li><p>
The Consecration begins with prayers by the priest. He shows the bread to the
faithful and recites teh words of Jesus, bowing. WHen says, "This is my
Body," we believe that the Holy Spirit works through the priest to
transubstantiate the bread: it is no longer bread, but God Himself, in His
fullness&#x2013;Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. The consecration of the bread is
followed by the priest elevating the Body of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the priest consecrates the wine with the words of Jesus, "&#x2026; this
is the chalice of my blood &#x2026;", followed by an elevation.
</p></li>
<li>Next, we pray the Lord's prayer, inviting God to be Lord of our lives with
the words, "&#x2026;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done&#x2026;"</li>
<li><p>
Following this, the Catholic faithful are invited to receive the Body and
Blood of Christ. This is the most intimate interaction we can have with God
in this present life, and far more intimate than any act of intimacy we can
perform with another human.
</p>

<p>
Non-Catholics and Catholics not properly prepared to receive the Eucharist
also may approach, but they should not receive. Catholics and 
non-Catholics alike can indicate their intention <b>not to receive</b> by crossing
their arms in front of their chest. The priest or Eucharistic minister will
then give a blessing. I recommend non-Catholics and unprepared Catholics
still approach the priest or Eucharistic minister, since this allows a better
flow of people. The faithful return to their pews and kneel reverently in
prayer of thanksgiving for the great and intimate gift of Christ's Body that
He himself gives us.
</p></li>
<li>The priest will then cleanse the sacred vessels, give closing prayers and a
blessing, and dismiss the Mass with the words, "Mass is ended. Go in peace."</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org0e9d692"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> The Mass as Two-fold a Sacrifice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
The Catholic teaching is that the Mass is a holy sacrifice. Actually, it is
two-fold. One sacrifice is by the priest, who sacrifices the Body and Blood of Jesus to God the Father on
behalf of the Church. The other sacrifice is that of the lay faithful, who
present their bodies to God as a living offering, in accordance with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A1-2&amp;version=NKJV">Romans
12:1-2</a>.

<h3 id="org35cb96f"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Scriptural Basis for the Real Presence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Belief in the Real Presence comes from the teachings of St. Paul and Jesus
Himself. Starting with Jesus, we have Jesus saying in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A22-69&amp;version=ESV">John 6:22-69 (ESV)</a> that He
would give believers His flesh and blood to eat and drink. When this repulsed His audence, they
admitted this was a hard saying. Jesus didn't say they misunderstood Him, nor
did he indicate that He was being symbolic. In fact, when many of His followers
left Him over this, he did not say they misunderstood Him, but rather let them
go and asked the twelve apostles if they, too, were going to leave Him. He even
used graphic language using Greek that made it clear that they should <i>chew on</i>
or <i>gnaw on</i> His flesh. Later, at the Last Supper, this is what Jesus said to
His disciples:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave
it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” 
</p>

<p>
27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink
from it, all of you. 28 For this is My blood of the [d]new covenant, which is
shed for many for the remission of sins.
</p>

<p>
(Matthew 26:26-28 NKJV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
St. Paul's retelling of the Last Supper also says Jesus told His disciples to
eat of His body:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the
Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; 24 and when He
had given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat; this is My body which is
[e]broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 25 In the same manner He also
took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My
blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” 
</p>

<p>
26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord’s death till He comes.
</p>

<p>
(1 Corinthians 11:23-26 NKJV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The doctrine of the Real Presence also comes with some important historical
evidence. Since John the Evangelist wrote John 6, one of John's students,
Ignatius of Antioch writes clearly about his interpretation of John's work: he
interpret's his teacher's writing in John 6 to be <i>litera</i>, not merely
symbolic. Here is what Ignatius writes about the Real Presence:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect to the grace of
Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God. They
have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed;
of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.
</p>

<p>
They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the
Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our
sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore,
who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes.
</p>
